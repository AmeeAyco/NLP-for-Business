Alice’s Evidence\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I.\\r\\nDown the Rabbit-Hole\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\\r\\nbank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\\r\\nthe book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\r\\nconversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\\r\\n“without pictures or conversations?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\r\\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\\r\\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\r\\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\r\\nclose by her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\\r\\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\\r\\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\\r\\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\r\\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\r\\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\r\\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\r\\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\r\\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\r\\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\r\\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\r\\nin the world she was to get out again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\r\\ndipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\r\\nabout stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\r\\ndeep well.\\r\\n\\r\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\r\\nplenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\r\\nwas going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\\r\\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\r\\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\r\\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\r\\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\r\\npassed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\\r\\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\r\\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\r\\ncupboards as she fell past it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\\r\\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\\r\\nat home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\r\\ntop of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\\r\\nmany miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\\r\\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\\r\\nbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\\r\\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\r\\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\\r\\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\r\\npractice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\\r\\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\\r\\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\r\\ngrand words to say.)\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\\r\\nthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\r\\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\\r\\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\\r\\nthe right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\r\\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\\r\\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\\r\\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\\r\\nan ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\\r\\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\r\\ntalking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\\r\\n(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\\r\\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\\r\\nno mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\\r\\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\\r\\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\r\\ndreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\\r\\nsometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\\r\\neither question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt\\r\\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\r\\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\r\\n“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,\\r\\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\r\\nthe fall was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\r\\nshe looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\r\\nlong passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\\r\\nit. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\\r\\nand was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\\r\\nand whiskers, how late it’s getting!” She was close behind it when she\\r\\nturned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\r\\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\r\\nfrom the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\r\\nAlice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\r\\ndoor, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\r\\nget out again.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\r\\nglass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\\r\\nfirst thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\r\\nbut, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\r\\nbut at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\\r\\ntime round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\r\\nbehind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\r\\nlittle golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\r\\nmuch larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\\r\\npassage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get\\r\\nout of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\r\\nflowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\r\\nthrough the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\\r\\npoor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,\\r\\nhow I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only\\r\\nknew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\\r\\nhappened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\\r\\nindeed were really impossible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\r\\nback to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\r\\nany rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\r\\ntime she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\\r\\nbefore,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\r\\nlabel, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\\r\\nletters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\\r\\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\\r\\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\\r\\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\\r\\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\\r\\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\\r\\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\\r\\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\\r\\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\\r\\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\\r\\nsooner or later.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\\r\\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\\r\\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\\r\\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\r\\n\\r\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\\r\\ntelescope.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\r\\nbrightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\r\\nthrough the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\\r\\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\r\\nshe felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\\r\\nsaid Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle. I\\r\\nwonder what I should be like then?” And she tried to fancy what the\\r\\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\\r\\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\r\\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\\r\\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\r\\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\r\\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\r\\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\r\\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\r\\nsat down and cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself,\\r\\nrather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!” She generally\\r\\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\r\\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\r\\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\r\\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\r\\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\\r\\n“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\\r\\npeople! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\\r\\nperson!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\r\\nshe opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\r\\n“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\\r\\nAlice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\r\\nmakes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\\r\\nget into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Which\\r\\nway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\r\\ngrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\r\\nsize: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\r\\nhad got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\r\\nthings to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\\r\\non in the common way.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\\r\\n\\r\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II.\\r\\nThe Pool of Tears\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Curiouser and curiouser!” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\r\\nfor the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\\r\\nopening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!”\\r\\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\r\\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\\r\\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\\r\\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\r\\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\\r\\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\\r\\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\\r\\nChristmas.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\\r\\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\\r\\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\\r\\n\\r\\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\\r\\n     Alice’s love_).\\r\\n\\r\\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\r\\nnow more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\r\\nkey and hurried off to the garden door.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\r\\nlook through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\r\\nhopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\\r\\nyou,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way! Stop\\r\\nthis moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same, shedding\\r\\ngallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\\r\\nfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\r\\nshe hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White\\r\\nRabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\\r\\nin one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\\r\\ngreat hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the\\r\\nDuchess! Oh! won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt\\r\\nso desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\\r\\nRabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\\r\\nsir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\\r\\nthe fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\r\\nkept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How\\r\\nqueer everything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual.\\r\\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\\r\\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\\r\\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\\r\\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\\r\\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\\r\\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\\r\\nringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\\r\\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\\r\\nvery little! Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\\r\\npuzzling it all is! I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know.\\r\\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\\r\\nand four times seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\\r\\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\\r\\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\\r\\nRome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain! I must have been\\r\\nchanged for Mabel! I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\\r\\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\\r\\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\\r\\ndid not come the same as they used to do:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“How doth the little crocodile\\r\\n    Improve his shining tail,\\r\\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\\r\\n    On every golden scale!\\r\\n\\r\\n“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\r\\n    How neatly spread his claws,\\r\\nAnd welcome little fishes in\\r\\n    With gently smiling jaws!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\\r\\nfilled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\\r\\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\r\\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\\r\\nmade up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here! It’ll be\\r\\nno use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear!’\\r\\nI shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\\r\\nthen, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\\r\\nhere till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden\\r\\nburst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so\\r\\n_very_ tired of being all alone here!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\r\\nthat she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\\r\\nshe was talking. “How _can_ I have done that?” she thought. “I must be\\r\\ngrowing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measure\\r\\nherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\\r\\nnow about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\\r\\nfound out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\\r\\ndropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\r\\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\\r\\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\\r\\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\\r\\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\\r\\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\\r\\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\r\\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\\r\\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\\r\\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\\r\\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\r\\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\r\\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\r\\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\\r\\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\\r\\nshe was nine feet high.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\r\\nto find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\r\\nbeing drowned in my own tears! That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\\r\\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\r\\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\r\\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\r\\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\r\\nslipped in like herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse?\\r\\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\r\\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So she\\r\\nbegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\\r\\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\\r\\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\r\\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\\r\\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\\r\\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\r\\nbut it said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\\r\\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.” (For, with all\\r\\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\r\\nanything had happened.) So she began again: “Où est ma chatte?” which\\r\\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\\r\\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\\r\\nfright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\\r\\nhad hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot you didn’t like\\r\\ncats.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. “Would\\r\\n_you_ like cats if you were me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\\r\\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\\r\\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\\r\\nquiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\\r\\nin the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\\r\\npaws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\\r\\nnurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\\r\\npardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\\r\\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “We won’t talk\\r\\nabout her any more if you’d rather not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\r\\ntail. “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\\r\\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name\\r\\nagain!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\r\\nconversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs?” The Mouse did not\\r\\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\\r\\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\r\\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\\r\\nyou throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\r\\nof things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\\r\\nknow, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says\\r\\nit kills all the rats and—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\\r\\n“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming away\\r\\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\\r\\npool as it went.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\\r\\nwon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!” When the\\r\\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\\r\\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\r\\ntrembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\\r\\nhistory, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\r\\nbirds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\\r\\nDodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice\\r\\nled the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III.\\r\\nA Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank—the\\r\\nbirds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\\r\\nto them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\\r\\nconsultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite\\r\\nnatural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if\\r\\nshe had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument\\r\\nwith the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, “I am\\r\\nolder than you, and must know better;” and this Alice would not allow\\r\\nwithout knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to\\r\\ntell its age, there was no more to be said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\\r\\ncalled out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! _I’ll_ soon make\\r\\nyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the\\r\\nMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she\\r\\nfelt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you all ready? This\\r\\nis the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ‘William\\r\\nthe Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\\r\\nto by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\\r\\naccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of\\r\\nMercia and Northumbria—’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: “Did\\r\\nyou speak?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed. ‘Edwin and Morcar,\\r\\nthe earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even\\r\\nStigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable—’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Found _what_?” said the Duck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Found _it_,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “of course you know\\r\\nwhat ‘it’ means.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when _I_ find a thing,” said the\\r\\nDuck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\\r\\narchbishop find?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, “‘—found\\r\\nit advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him\\r\\nthe crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence\\r\\nof his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued,\\r\\nturning to Alice as it spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to\\r\\ndry me at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, “I move\\r\\nthat the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\\r\\nremedies—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know the meaning of half\\r\\nthose long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!” And\\r\\nthe Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\\r\\ntittered audibly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone, “was,\\r\\nthat the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What _is_ a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wanted much to\\r\\nknow, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that _somebody_ ought to\\r\\nspeak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to do it.” (And,\\r\\nas you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will\\r\\ntell you how the Dodo managed it.)\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\\r\\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\\r\\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\\r\\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\\r\\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\\r\\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\\r\\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\\r\\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\\r\\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\\r\\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\\r\\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\\r\\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\\r\\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\\r\\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\\r\\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\\r\\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\\r\\none a-piece, all round.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\\r\\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\\r\\npresented the thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegant\\r\\nthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all\\r\\ncheered.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\\r\\nthat she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\\r\\nto say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as\\r\\nshe could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\\r\\nconfusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\\r\\ntheirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\\r\\nHowever, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\\r\\nbegged the Mouse to tell them something more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why\\r\\nit is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\\r\\nwould be offended again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\\r\\nsighing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It _is_ a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder\\r\\nat the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on\\r\\npuzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the\\r\\ntale was something like this:—\\r\\n\\r\\n         “Fury said to a mouse, That he met in the house, ‘Let us both\\r\\n         go to law: _I_ will prosecute _you_.—Come, I’ll take no\\r\\n         denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I’ve\\r\\n         nothing to do.’ Said the mouse to the cur, ‘Such a trial, dear\\r\\n         sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’\\r\\n         ‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’ Said cunning old Fury: ‘I’ll\\r\\n         try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are\\r\\nyou thinking of?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth\\r\\nbend, I think?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had _not!_” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking\\r\\nanxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and\\r\\nwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “But you’re so easily offended,\\r\\nyou know!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it; and\\r\\nthe others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but the Mouse only\\r\\nshook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon as it was\\r\\nquite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to\\r\\nher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose\\r\\n_your_ temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young Crab, a little\\r\\nsnappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of an oyster!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,\\r\\naddressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” said the\\r\\nLory.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:\\r\\n“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice you\\r\\ncan’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why,\\r\\nshe’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the\\r\\nbirds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very\\r\\ncarefully, remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air\\r\\ndoesn’t suit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice\\r\\nto its children, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all in\\r\\nbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\\r\\nalone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in a melancholy\\r\\ntone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sure she’s the best\\r\\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\\r\\nany more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\\r\\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\\r\\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\\r\\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\\r\\ncoming back to finish his story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV.\\r\\nThe Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\\r\\nanxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\\r\\nit muttering to itself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\\r\\nmy fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\\r\\nferrets! Where _can_ I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a\\r\\nmoment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\\r\\ngloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\\r\\nthey were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\\r\\nher swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\\r\\nlittle door, had vanished completely.\\r\\n\\r\\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\\r\\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\\r\\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\\r\\na fan! Quick, now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\\r\\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\\r\\nmistake it had made.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran. “How\\r\\nsurprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\\r\\nhis fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” As she said this, she\\r\\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\r\\nplate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. She went in without\\r\\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\r\\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\r\\nfan and gloves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\\r\\na rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!” And she\\r\\nbegan fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice! Come\\r\\nhere directly, and get ready for your walk!’ ‘Coming in a minute,\\r\\nnurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I\\r\\ndon’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\\r\\nif it began ordering people about like that!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\r\\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\\r\\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\\r\\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\\r\\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\\r\\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\\r\\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\\r\\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\\r\\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\\r\\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\\r\\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\r\\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\\r\\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\\r\\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\\r\\ndrunk quite so much!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\\r\\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\\r\\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\\r\\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\\r\\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\r\\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\\r\\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?”\\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\r\\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\r\\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\r\\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\\r\\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\\r\\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and\\r\\nyet—it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\\r\\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\\r\\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\\r\\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\\r\\nwhen I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m grown up now,” she added in a\\r\\nsorrowful tone; “at least there’s no room to grow up any more _here_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I _never_ get any older than I am\\r\\nnow? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but\\r\\nthen—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like _that!_”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn\\r\\nlessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for _you_, and no room at all\\r\\nfor any lesson-books!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and\\r\\nmaking quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes\\r\\nshe heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my gloves this moment!”\\r\\nThen came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\\r\\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\\r\\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\\r\\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\\r\\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\\r\\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’ll\\r\\ngo round and get in at the window.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_That_ you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\\r\\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\\r\\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\\r\\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\\r\\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\\r\\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Where are you?” And\\r\\nthen a voice she had never heard before, “Sure then I’m here! Digging\\r\\nfor apples, yer honour!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\\r\\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\\r\\n\\r\\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\\r\\nwindow!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\\r\\nnow and then; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\\r\\nall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spread out her\\r\\nhand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\\r\\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What a number\\r\\nof cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonder what\\r\\nthey’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they\\r\\n_could!_ I’m sure _I_ don’t want to stay in here any longer!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\\r\\nrumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all\\r\\ntalking together: she made out the words: “Where’s the other\\r\\nladder?—Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill!\\r\\nfetch it here, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’em\\r\\ntogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll do\\r\\nwell enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catch hold of this\\r\\nrope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it’s coming down!\\r\\nHeads below!” (a loud crash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, I\\r\\nfancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, _I_ shan’t! _You_ do\\r\\nit!—_That_ I won’t, then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master says\\r\\nyou’re to go down the chimney!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” said Alice to\\r\\nherself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\\r\\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\\r\\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\\r\\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\\r\\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\\r\\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\\r\\nto see what would happen next.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\\r\\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\\r\\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\\r\\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\\r\\nus all about it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\\r\\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\\r\\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\\r\\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\\r\\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\\r\\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\\r\\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\\r\\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\\r\\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\\r\\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\\r\\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\\r\\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\\r\\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\\r\\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\\r\\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\\r\\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\\r\\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\\r\\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\\r\\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\\r\\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\\r\\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\\r\\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\\r\\nsafe in a thick wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, as she\\r\\nwandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the\\r\\nsecond thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that\\r\\nwill be the best plan.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\\r\\narranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\\r\\nhow to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\\r\\nthe trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\\r\\ngreat hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\\r\\nfeebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little\\r\\nthing!” said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to\\r\\nit; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it\\r\\nmight be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in\\r\\nspite of all her coaxing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\\r\\nheld it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\\r\\nall its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\\r\\nand made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\\r\\nto keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\\r\\nother side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\r\\nover heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\\r\\nvery like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\\r\\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\\r\\nthe puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\r\\nlittle way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\r\\nall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\r\\nits tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\\r\\nset off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,\\r\\nand till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leant\\r\\nagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\\r\\nleaves: “I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’d\\r\\nonly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\\r\\nI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? I\\r\\nsuppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\\r\\nquestion is, what?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\\r\\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\\r\\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\\r\\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\\r\\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\\r\\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\\r\\nwas on the top of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\\r\\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\\r\\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\\r\\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of\\r\\nanything else.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V.\\r\\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\\r\\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\\r\\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\\r\\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\\r\\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\\r\\nchanged several times since then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly. “Explain\\r\\nyourself!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t explain _myself_, I’m afraid, sir,” said Alice, “because I’m\\r\\nnot myself, you see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice replied very politely,\\r\\n“for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\\r\\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice; “but when you\\r\\nhave to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then\\r\\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\\r\\nqueer, won’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know\\r\\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who are _you?_”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\\r\\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such _very_\\r\\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I\\r\\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\\r\\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\\r\\nstate of mind, she turned away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’ve something\\r\\nimportant to say!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\\r\\ncould.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\\r\\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\\r\\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\\r\\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you\\r\\nthink you’re changed, do you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t remember things as I\\r\\nused—and I don’t keep the same size for ten minutes together!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can’t remember _what_ things?” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busy bee,” but it all\\r\\ncame different!” Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Repeat, “_You are old, Father William_,’” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice folded her hands, and began:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,\\r\\n    “And your hair has become very white;\\r\\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head—\\r\\n    Do you think, at your age, it is right?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,\\r\\n    “I feared it might injure the brain;\\r\\nBut, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,\\r\\n    Why, I do it again and again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,\\r\\n    And have grown most uncommonly fat;\\r\\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—\\r\\n    Pray, what is the reason of that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\\r\\n    “I kept all my limbs very supple\\r\\nBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—\\r\\n    Allow me to sell you a couple?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak\\r\\n    For anything tougher than suet;\\r\\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—\\r\\n    Pray, how did you manage to do it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,\\r\\n    And argued each case with my wife;\\r\\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\\r\\n    Has lasted the rest of my life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose\\r\\n    That your eye was as steady as ever;\\r\\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—\\r\\n    What made you so awfully clever?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”\\r\\n    Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!\\r\\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\\r\\n    Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not _quite_ right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly; “some of the\\r\\nwords have got altered.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillar decidedly,\\r\\nand there was silence for some minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What size do you want to be?” it asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied; “only one\\r\\ndoesn’t like changing so often, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I _don’t_ know,” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\\r\\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn’t\\r\\nmind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretched height to be.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,\\r\\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\\r\\nthought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so easily\\r\\noffended!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and it put the\\r\\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\\r\\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\\r\\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\\r\\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\\r\\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\\r\\ngrow shorter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\\r\\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\\r\\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\\r\\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\\r\\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\\r\\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\\r\\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\\r\\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\\r\\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\\r\\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\\r\\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\\r\\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\\r\\nlefthand bit.\\r\\n\\r\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n    *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone of delight, which\\r\\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\\r\\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\\r\\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\\r\\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What _can_ all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “And where _have_ my\\r\\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?”\\r\\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\\r\\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\\r\\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\\r\\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\\r\\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\\r\\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\\r\\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\\r\\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\\r\\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m _not_ a serpent!” said Alice indignantly. “Let me alone!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\\r\\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, and nothing\\r\\nseems to suit them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\\r\\nhedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; “but those\\r\\nserpents! There’s no pleasing them!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\\r\\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\\r\\n\\r\\n“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said the Pigeon;\\r\\n“but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\\r\\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\\r\\nsee its meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\\r\\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\\r\\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\\r\\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\\r\\ninvent something!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\\r\\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\\r\\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\\r\\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s\\r\\nno use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never\\r\\ntasted an egg!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a very truthful\\r\\nchild; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\\r\\nknow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do, why then\\r\\nthey’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\\r\\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’re\\r\\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\\r\\nme whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It matters a good deal to _me_,” said Alice hastily; “but I’m not\\r\\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want\\r\\n_yours_: I don’t like them raw.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\\r\\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\\r\\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\\r\\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\\r\\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\\r\\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\\r\\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\\r\\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\\r\\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\\r\\nand began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\\r\\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\\r\\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\\r\\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\\r\\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\\r\\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\\r\\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\\r\\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\\r\\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\\r\\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI.\\r\\nPig and Pepper\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\\r\\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\\r\\nwood—(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\\r\\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\\r\\nfish)—and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\\r\\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\\r\\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\\r\\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\\r\\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\\r\\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\\r\\nsaying, in a solemn tone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the\\r\\nQueen to play croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\\r\\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, “From the Queen.\\r\\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\\r\\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\\r\\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\\r\\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman, “and that for\\r\\ntwo reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\\r\\nare; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\\r\\npossibly hear you.” And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\\r\\nnoise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\\r\\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\\r\\npieces.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on\\r\\nwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,\\r\\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\\r\\nknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\\r\\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t help it,”\\r\\nshe said to herself; “his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\\r\\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am I to get in?”\\r\\nshe repeated, aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “till tomorrow—”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\\r\\nskimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\\r\\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\\r\\nas if nothing had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Are_ you to get in at all?” said the Footman. “That’s the first\\r\\nquestion, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’s really\\r\\ndreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all the creatures argue.\\r\\nIt’s enough to drive one crazy!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\\r\\nremark, with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off, for\\r\\ndays and days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what am _I_ to do?” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alice desperately: “he’s\\r\\nperfectly idiotic!” And she opened the door and went in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\\r\\none end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool\\r\\nin the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,\\r\\nstirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice said to\\r\\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed\\r\\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\\r\\nalternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\\r\\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\\r\\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\\r\\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, “why\\r\\nyour cat grins like that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “and that’s why. Pig!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\\r\\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\\r\\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t\\r\\nknow that cats _could_ grin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’em do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely, feeling quite\\r\\npleased to have got into a conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “and that’s a fact.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\\r\\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\\r\\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\\r\\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\\r\\nthe Duchess and the baby—the fire-irons came first; then followed a\\r\\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\\r\\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\\r\\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, _please_ mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice, jumping up and down\\r\\nin an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!” as an\\r\\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\\r\\noff.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in a hoarse\\r\\ngrowl, “the world would go round a deal faster than it does.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which would _not_ be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt very glad to\\r\\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just\\r\\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\\r\\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off her head!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\\r\\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\\r\\nbe listening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\\r\\nis it twelve? I—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, don’t bother _me_,” said the Duchess; “I never could abide\\r\\nfigures!” And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\\r\\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\\r\\nthe end of every line:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Speak roughly to your little boy,\\r\\n    And beat him when he sneezes:\\r\\nHe only does it to annoy,\\r\\n    Because he knows it teases.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHORUS.\\r\\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\\r\\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\\r\\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“I speak severely to my boy,\\r\\n    I beat him when he sneezes;\\r\\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\\r\\n    The pepper when he pleases!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHORUS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wow! wow! wow!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said to Alice,\\r\\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to play\\r\\ncroquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cook\\r\\nthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\\r\\nlittle creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,\\r\\n“just like a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was\\r\\nsnorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling\\r\\nitself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for\\r\\nthe first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\\r\\ntwist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\\r\\near and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it\\r\\nout into the open air. “If I don’t take this child away with me,”\\r\\nthought Alice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\\r\\nmurder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and the\\r\\nlittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\\r\\n“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all a proper way of\\r\\nexpressing yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face\\r\\nto see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\\r\\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\\r\\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\\r\\nnot like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\\r\\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\\r\\nwere any tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,”\\r\\nsaid Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\\r\\nnow!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\\r\\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do\\r\\nwith this creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so\\r\\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\\r\\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\\r\\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\\r\\nfurther.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\\r\\ntrot away quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said to\\r\\nherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\\r\\nrather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other\\r\\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\\r\\nto herself, “if one only knew the right way to change them—” when she\\r\\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\\r\\na tree a few yards off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\\r\\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\\r\\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\\r\\nwhether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little\\r\\nwider. “Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.\\r\\n“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“—so long as I get _somewhere_,” Alice added as an explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if you only walk long\\r\\nenough.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another\\r\\nquestion. “What sort of people live about here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In _that_ direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives\\r\\na Hatter: and in _that_ direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a\\r\\nMarch Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\\r\\nYou’re mad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “And how\\r\\ndo you know that you’re mad?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. You grant that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose so,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\\r\\nand wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now _I_ growl when I’m pleased,\\r\\nand wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_I_ call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquet with the\\r\\nQueen to-day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but I haven’t been invited\\r\\nyet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\\r\\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\\r\\nit suddenly appeared again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat. “I’d nearly\\r\\nforgotten to ask.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\\r\\nin a natural way.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\\r\\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\\r\\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she\\r\\nsaid to herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\\r\\nperhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so mad as it\\r\\nwas in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\\r\\nagain, sitting on a branch of a tree.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing\\r\\nand vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\\r\\nbeginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\\r\\nremained some time after the rest of it had gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice; “but a\\r\\ngrin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\\r\\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\\r\\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\\r\\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\\r\\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\\r\\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\\r\\ntimidly, saying to herself “Suppose it should be raving mad after all!\\r\\nI almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatter instead!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII.\\r\\nA Mad Tea-Party\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\\r\\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\\r\\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\\r\\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very\\r\\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep,\\r\\nI suppose it doesn’t mind.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\\r\\none corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw\\r\\nAlice coming. “There’s _plenty_ of room!” said Alice indignantly, and\\r\\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\\r\\n“I don’t see any wine,” she remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said\\r\\nthe March Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t know it was _your_ table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great\\r\\nmany more than three.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at\\r\\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\\r\\nspeech.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said with some\\r\\nseverity; “it’s very rude.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\\r\\nwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they’ve\\r\\nbegun asking riddles.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?” said\\r\\nthe March Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly so,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least I mean what I\\r\\nsay—that’s the same thing, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might just as well\\r\\nsay that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that ‘I like what\\r\\nI get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what I like’!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\\r\\ntalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is the same thing\\r\\nas ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It _is_ the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and here the\\r\\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\\r\\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\\r\\nwriting-desks, which wasn’t much.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month\\r\\nis it?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\\r\\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\\r\\nand holding it to his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butter wouldn’t suit\\r\\nthe works!” he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was the _best_ butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hatter grumbled:\\r\\n“you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\\r\\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\\r\\nnothing better to say than his first remark, “It was the _best_ butter,\\r\\nyou know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What a\\r\\nfunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\\r\\ntell what o’clock it is!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does _your_ watch tell you what\\r\\nyear it is?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “but that’s because it\\r\\nstays the same year for such a long time together.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which is just the case with _mine_,” said the Hatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\\r\\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quite\\r\\nunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured a little\\r\\nhot tea upon its nose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\\r\\neyes, “Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s the answer?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nor I,” said the March Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with the\\r\\ntime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have no\\r\\nanswers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk\\r\\nabout wasting _it_. It’s _him_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\\r\\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\\r\\ntime when I learn music.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\\r\\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\\r\\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\\r\\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\\r\\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\\r\\ntime for dinner!”\\r\\n\\r\\n(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\\r\\n\\r\\n“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully: “but then—I\\r\\nshouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keep it to\\r\\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that the way _you_ manage?” Alice asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied. “We\\r\\nquarrelled last March—just before _he_ went mad, you know—” (pointing\\r\\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) “—it was at the great concert\\r\\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\\r\\nHow I wonder what you’re at!’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou know the song, perhaps?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in this way:—\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Up above the world you fly,\\r\\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\\r\\n                    Twinkle, twinkle—’”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\\r\\n“_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_—” and went on so long that they\\r\\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter, “when the\\r\\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his\\r\\nhead!’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, “he won’t\\r\\ndo a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so many\\r\\ntea-things are put out here?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh: “it’s always tea-time,\\r\\nand we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get used up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Alice ventured\\r\\nto ask.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\\r\\n“I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, rather alarmed at the\\r\\nproposal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up, Dormouse!” And\\r\\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a\\r\\nhoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’ll be asleep again\\r\\nbefore it’s done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormouse began\\r\\nin a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\\r\\nthey lived at the bottom of a well—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a great interest\\r\\nin questions of eating and drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\\r\\ntwo.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gently remarked;\\r\\n“they’d have been ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “_very_ ill.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\\r\\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But\\r\\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone, “so I can’t\\r\\ntake more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean you can’t take _less_,” said the Hatter: “it’s very easy to\\r\\ntake _more_ than nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nobody asked _your_ opinion,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter asked triumphantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\\r\\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\\r\\nrepeated her question. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\\r\\nsaid, “It was a treacle-well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\\r\\nHatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily\\r\\nremarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\\r\\nyourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’t interrupt again. I\\r\\ndare say there may be _one_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\\r\\ngo on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning to draw,\\r\\nyou know—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’s all move one place\\r\\non.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\\r\\nmoved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\\r\\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\\r\\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\\r\\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\\r\\ncautiously: “But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\\r\\nfrom?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter; “so I should\\r\\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But they were _in_ the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\\r\\nto notice this last remark.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—well in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\\r\\nsome time without interrupting it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\\r\\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew all manner of\\r\\nthings—everything that begins with an M—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why with an M?” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not?” said the March Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was silent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\\r\\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\\r\\nlittle shriek, and went on: “—that begins with an M, such as\\r\\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say\\r\\nthings are “much of a muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a\\r\\ndrawing of a muchness?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “I don’t\\r\\nthink—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\\r\\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\\r\\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\\r\\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\\r\\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\\r\\nthe teapot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At any rate I’ll never go _there_ again!” said Alice as she picked her\\r\\nway through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in\\r\\nall my life!”\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\\r\\nleading right into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “But\\r\\neverything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.” And\\r\\nin she went.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\\r\\nglass table. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said to herself,\\r\\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\\r\\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\\r\\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\\r\\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\\r\\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\\r\\nand the cool fountains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\r\\nThe Queen’s Croquet-Ground\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\\r\\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\\r\\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\\r\\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\\r\\none of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\\r\\nlike that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone; “Seven jogged my\\r\\nelbow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always lay the\\r\\nblame on others!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_You’d_ better not talk!” said Five. “I heard the Queen say only\\r\\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s none of _your_ business, Two!” said Seven.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it _is_ his business!” said Five, “and I’ll tell him—it was for\\r\\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjust\\r\\nthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\\r\\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\\r\\nand all of them bowed low.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why you are\\r\\npainting those roses?”\\r\\n\\r\\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\\r\\nvoice, “Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\\r\\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\\r\\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\\r\\nyou see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At this\\r\\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\\r\\nout “The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threw\\r\\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\\r\\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\\r\\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\\r\\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\\r\\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\\r\\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\\r\\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\\r\\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\\r\\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\\r\\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\\r\\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\\r\\nthe King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\\r\\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\r\\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\r\\nof such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\\r\\nprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\\r\\nfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where she was,\\r\\nand waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\r\\nat her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the\\r\\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\\r\\nAlice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice very politely;\\r\\nbut she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\\r\\nall. I needn’t be afraid of them!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who are _these?_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\\r\\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\\r\\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\\r\\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\\r\\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How should _I_ know?” said Alice, surprised at her own courage. “It’s\\r\\nno business of _mine_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\r\\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\r\\nsilent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\\r\\ndear: she is only a child!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\\r\\nthem over!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\\r\\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\\r\\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make me giddy.” And then,\\r\\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, “What _have_ you been doing\\r\\nhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone, going\\r\\ndown on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_I_ see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\\r\\n“Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on, three of the\\r\\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\\r\\nto Alice for protection.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into a large\\r\\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\\r\\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\\r\\nothers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiers shouted\\r\\nin reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you play croquet?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was\\r\\nevidently meant for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes!” shouted Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\\r\\nwondering very much what would happen next.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voice at her side. She was\\r\\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\\r\\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\\r\\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\\r\\nsentence of execution.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What for?” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\\r\\n‘What for?’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\\r\\nscream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\\r\\ntone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\\r\\nQueen said—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\\r\\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\\r\\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\\r\\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\\r\\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\\r\\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\\r\\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\\r\\nshe succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,\\r\\nunder her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she\\r\\nhad got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the\\r\\nhedgehog a blow with its head, it _would_ twist itself round and look\\r\\nup in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help\\r\\nbursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was\\r\\ngoing to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog\\r\\nhad unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\\r\\nthis, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\\r\\nwanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were\\r\\nalways getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice\\r\\nsoon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\r\\nall the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\\r\\nthe Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\r\\nshouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a\\r\\nminute.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\r\\ndispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\r\\n“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\\r\\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any\\r\\none left alive!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\\r\\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\\r\\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\\r\\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\\r\\nto herself “It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\\r\\nto.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\r\\nenough for it to speak with.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no use\\r\\nspeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at least one\\r\\nof them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\\r\\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\\r\\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\\r\\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, in rather a\\r\\ncomplaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\\r\\noneself speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular; at\\r\\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them—and you’ve no idea how\\r\\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\\r\\narch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\\r\\nground—and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\\r\\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed\\r\\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\\r\\n“—likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who _are_ you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice, and\\r\\nlooking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice: “allow me to\\r\\nintroduce it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King: “however, it may\\r\\nkiss my hand if it likes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’t look at me like\\r\\nthat!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read that in some book,\\r\\nbut I don’t remember where.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and he called\\r\\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish you would\\r\\nhave this cat removed!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\\r\\nsmall. “Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly, and he\\r\\nhurried off.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\\r\\non, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\\r\\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\\r\\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\\r\\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\r\\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\r\\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\r\\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\\r\\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\\r\\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\\r\\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’t\\r\\nmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from this side\\r\\nof the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\\r\\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\\r\\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\\r\\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\\r\\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\\r\\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\\r\\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\\r\\nwhat they said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\\r\\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\\r\\nthing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at _his_ time of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\r\\nbeheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in\\r\\nless than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was\\r\\nthis last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and\\r\\nanxious.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the\\r\\nDuchess: you’d better ask _her_ about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner: “fetch her here.”\\r\\nAnd the executioner went off like an arrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the\\r\\ntime he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so\\r\\nthe King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,\\r\\nwhile the rest of the party went back to the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IX.\\r\\nThe Mock Turtle’s Story\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!”\\r\\nsaid the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,\\r\\nand they walked off together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\\r\\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\\r\\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\\r\\ntone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\\r\\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\\r\\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\\r\\nkind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\\r\\nthem bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\\r\\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\\r\\nso stingy about it, you know—”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\\r\\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\\r\\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\\r\\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\\r\\na bit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\\r\\nyou can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\\r\\nshe spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\\r\\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\\r\\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\\r\\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\\r\\nbore it as well as she could.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way of keeping up\\r\\nthe conversation a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love,\\r\\n’tis love, that makes the world go round!’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done by everybody minding\\r\\ntheir own business!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, digging her\\r\\nsharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and the moral of\\r\\n_that_ is—‘Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\\r\\nthemselves.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought to\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,”\\r\\nthe Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\\r\\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\\r\\nto have the experiment tried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\\r\\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\\r\\nputting things!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\\r\\neverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\\r\\nAnd the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\\r\\nof yours.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\\r\\nremark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\\r\\nis—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\\r\\nsimply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\\r\\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\\r\\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\\r\\notherwise.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\\r\\n“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchess replied,\\r\\nin a pleased tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,” said\\r\\nAlice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “I make you a present\\r\\nof everything I’ve said as yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m glad they don’t give\\r\\nbirthday presents like that!” But she did not venture to say it out\\r\\nloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\\r\\nlittle chin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\\r\\nfeel a little worried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs have to fly; and\\r\\nthe m—”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,\\r\\neven in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was\\r\\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\\r\\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\\r\\nthunderstorm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\\r\\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\\r\\nabout half no time! Take your choice!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\\r\\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\\r\\ncroquet-ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\\r\\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\\r\\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\\r\\nwould cost them their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\\r\\nwith the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\\r\\nher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\\r\\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\\r\\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\\r\\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\\r\\nand under sentence of execution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Have\\r\\nyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said the Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you his history,”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\\r\\nto the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\\r\\ngood thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\\r\\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\\r\\nyou don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\\r\\nthing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\\r\\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\\r\\nexecutions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\\r\\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\\r\\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\\r\\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\\r\\nshe was out of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon,\\r\\nhalf to itself, half to Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What _is_ the fun?” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, _she_,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all her fancy, that: they never\\r\\nexecutes nobody, you know. Come on!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as she went slowly\\r\\nafter it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\\r\\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\\r\\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\\r\\npitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\\r\\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\\r\\nhis fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\\r\\nfull of tears, but said nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your\\r\\nhistory, she do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: “sit\\r\\ndown, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\\r\\nherself, “I don’t see how he can _ever_ finish, if he doesn’t begin.”\\r\\nBut she waited patiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real\\r\\nTurtle.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\\r\\noccasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant\\r\\nheavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\\r\\nsaying, “Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could not\\r\\nhelp thinking there _must_ be more to come, so she sat still and said\\r\\nnothing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\\r\\nthough still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the\\r\\nsea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle\\r\\nangrily: “really you are very dull!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\\r\\nquestion,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked\\r\\nat poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the\\r\\nGryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all\\r\\nday about it!” and he went on in these words:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\\r\\nThe Mock Turtle went on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_I’ve_ been to a day-school, too,” said Alice; “you needn’t be so\\r\\nproud as all that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a\\r\\ntone of great relief. “Now at _ours_ they had at the end of the bill,\\r\\n‘French, music, _and washing_—extra.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom\\r\\nof the sea.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I\\r\\nonly took the regular course.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What was that?” inquired Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle\\r\\nreplied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,\\r\\nDistraction, Uglification, and Derision.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard of\\r\\nuglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\\r\\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\\r\\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\\r\\nsubjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\\r\\nSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\\r\\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\\r\\nFainting in Coils.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\\r\\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classics master,\\r\\nthough. He was an old crab, _he_ was.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “he taught\\r\\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\\r\\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry\\r\\nto change the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so\\r\\non.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked:\\r\\n“because they lessen from day to day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\\r\\nbefore she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been\\r\\na holiday?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very\\r\\ndecided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER X.\\r\\nThe Lobster Quadrille\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\\r\\nhis eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\\r\\ntwo sobs choked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,”\\r\\nsaid the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\\r\\nthe back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\\r\\nrunning down his cheeks, he went on again:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“I haven’t,” said\\r\\nAlice)—“and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster—”\\r\\n(Alice began to say “I once tasted—” but checked herself hastily, and\\r\\nsaid “No, never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\\r\\nLobster Quadrille is!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line along the\\r\\nsea-shore—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\\r\\nthen, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_That_ generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“—you advance twice—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set to partners—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued the Gryphon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throw the—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n“—as far out to sea as you can—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\\r\\nabout.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” said the Mock\\r\\nTurtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had\\r\\nbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very\\r\\nsadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very much indeed,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle to the\\r\\nGryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, _you_ sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’ve forgotten the words.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\\r\\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\\r\\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\\r\\nand sadly:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\\r\\n“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.\\r\\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\\r\\nThey are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?\\r\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\r\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\\r\\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”\\r\\nBut the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—\\r\\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\\r\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\\r\\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.\\r\\n“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\\r\\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France—\\r\\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\\r\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?\\r\\nWill you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” said Alice,\\r\\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like that\\r\\ncurious song about the whiting!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle, “they—you’ve seen them,\\r\\nof course?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them at dinn—” she checked herself\\r\\nhastily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve\\r\\nseen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have their tails in\\r\\ntheir mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle: “crumbs would\\r\\nall wash off in the sea. But they _have_ their tails in their mouths;\\r\\nand the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his\\r\\neyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,” he said to the Gryphon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they _would_ go with the\\r\\nlobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to\\r\\nfall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they\\r\\ncouldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much\\r\\nabout a whiting before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\\r\\nknow why it’s called a whiting?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\\r\\nin a wondering tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\\r\\nmakes them so shiny?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\\r\\nanswer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\\r\\n“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\\r\\n“any shrimp could have told you that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts were still\\r\\nrunning on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back,\\r\\nplease: we don’t want _you_ with us!’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said: “no\\r\\nwise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish came to _me_,\\r\\nand told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With what porpoise?’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\\r\\nthe Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\\r\\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\\r\\nbecause I was a different person then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\\r\\n“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\\r\\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\\r\\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\\r\\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\\r\\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\\r\\nabout her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\\r\\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\\r\\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. “I\\r\\nshould like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to\\r\\nbegin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\\r\\nauthority over Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stand up and repeat ‘’_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,’” said the\\r\\nGryphon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”\\r\\nthought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, she got\\r\\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\\r\\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\\r\\nvery queer indeed:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\\r\\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\\r\\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\\r\\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[later editions continued as follows\\r\\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\\r\\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\\r\\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\\r\\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\\r\\nthe Gryphon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\\r\\nuncommon nonsense.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\\r\\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next\\r\\nverse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “How _could_ he turn\\r\\nthem out with his nose, you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but was dreadfully\\r\\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently: “it\\r\\nbegins ‘_I passed by his garden_.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\\r\\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\\r\\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”\\r\\n\\r\\n[later editions continued as follows\\r\\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\\r\\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\\r\\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\\r\\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\\r\\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\\r\\nAnd concluded the banquet—]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,” the Mock Turtle\\r\\ninterrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on? It’s by far the\\r\\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: and Alice was\\r\\nonly too glad to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphon\\r\\nwent on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alice\\r\\nreplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,\\r\\n“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old\\r\\nfellow?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\\r\\nwith sobs, to sing this:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\\r\\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\\r\\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\\r\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\r\\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\\r\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\r\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\r\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\r\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,\\r\\nGame, or any other dish?\\r\\nWho would not give all else for two p\\r\\nennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\r\\nPennyworth only of beautiful Soup?\\r\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\r\\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\\r\\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\r\\n    Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun\\r\\nto repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in the\\r\\ndistance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried\\r\\noff, without waiting for the end of the song.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon only\\r\\nanswered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintly\\r\\ncame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,\\r\\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XI.\\r\\nWho Stole the Tarts?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\\r\\narrived, with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little\\r\\nbirds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\\r\\nstanding before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\\r\\nhim; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one\\r\\nhand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the\\r\\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\\r\\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\\r\\nget the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\\r\\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\\r\\neverything about her, to pass away the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\\r\\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\\r\\nthe name of nearly everything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to\\r\\nherself, “because of his great wig.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\\r\\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\\r\\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\\r\\n(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\\r\\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\\r\\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\\r\\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\\r\\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\\r\\nwould have done just as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\\r\\nthey doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything\\r\\nto put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\\r\\n“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\\r\\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\\r\\ncourt!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\\r\\nto make out who was talking.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\\r\\nthat all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\\r\\nand she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\\r\\n“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\\r\\nmuddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\\r\\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\\r\\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\\r\\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\\r\\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\\r\\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\\r\\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\\r\\nunrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\\r\\n    All on a summer day:\\r\\nThe Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\\r\\n    And took them quite away!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great\\r\\ndeal to come before that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew\\r\\nthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand\\r\\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your\\r\\nMajesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\\r\\nmy tea when I was sent for.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\\r\\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\\r\\nwas,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\\r\\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\\r\\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Stolen!_” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\\r\\na memorandum of the fact.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none\\r\\nof my own. I’m a hatter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\\r\\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\\r\\nhave you executed on the spot.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\\r\\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\\r\\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\\r\\nbread-and-butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\\r\\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\\r\\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\\r\\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\\r\\nas long as there was room for her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\\r\\nnext to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\\r\\ntoo.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\\r\\nthat ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\\r\\nto the other side of the court.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\\r\\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\\r\\nof the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\\r\\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\\r\\noff.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or I’ll have you\\r\\nexecuted, whether you’re nervous or not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\\r\\n“—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not above a week or so—and what with the\\r\\nbread-and-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling of the tea—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The twinkling of the _what?_” said the King.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It _began_ with the tea,” the Hatter replied.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply. “Do you\\r\\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most things twinkled after\\r\\nthat—only the March Hare said—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did!” said the Hatter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I deny it!” said the March Hare.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on, looking\\r\\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\\r\\nnothing, being fast asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some more bread-and-butter—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You _must_ remember,” remarked the King, “or I’ll have you executed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\\r\\ndown on one knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re a _very_ poor _speaker_,” said the King.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\\r\\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\\r\\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\\r\\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\\r\\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice. “I’ve so often read in\\r\\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts at\\r\\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\\r\\ncourt,” and I never understood what it meant till now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,” continued the\\r\\nKing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m on the floor, as it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you may _sit_ down,” the King replied.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now we shall get\\r\\non better.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\\r\\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\\r\\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to one of the\\r\\nofficers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get\\r\\nto the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Call the next witness!” said the King.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\\r\\nher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the\\r\\ncourt, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give your evidence,” said the King.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shan’t,” said the cook.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,\\r\\n“Your Majesty must cross-examine _this_ witness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air, and,\\r\\nafter folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were\\r\\nnearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead that Dormouse!\\r\\nTurn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his\\r\\nwhiskers!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse\\r\\nturned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had\\r\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief. “Call the\\r\\nnext witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen, “Really, my\\r\\ndear, _you_ must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my\\r\\nforehead ache!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling\\r\\nvery curious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for they\\r\\nhaven’t got much evidence _yet_,” she said to herself. Imagine her\\r\\nsurprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill\\r\\nlittle voice, the name “Alice!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER XII.\\r\\nAlice’s Evidence\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here!” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\\r\\nlarge she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\\r\\na hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\\r\\nupsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\\r\\nthey lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of\\r\\ngoldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon!” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\r\\nbegan picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident\\r\\nof the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of\\r\\nidea that they must be collected at once and put back into the\\r\\njury-box, or they would die.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in a very grave voice, “until\\r\\nall the jurymen are back in their proper places—_all_,” he repeated\\r\\nwith great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\\r\\nthe Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\\r\\ntail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon\\r\\ngot it out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies much,” she\\r\\nsaid to herself; “I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\\r\\ntrial one way up as the other.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\\r\\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\\r\\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\\r\\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\\r\\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\r\\ncourt.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing _whatever?_” persisted the King.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were\\r\\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\\r\\nRabbit interrupted: “_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,” he\\r\\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\\r\\nhe spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Un_important, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said, and went on\\r\\nto himself in an undertone,\\r\\n\\r\\n“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—” as if he were trying\\r\\nwhich word sounded best.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some “unimportant.”\\r\\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\\r\\n“but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought to herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\\r\\nhis note-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book, “Rule\\r\\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEverybody looked at Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“_I’m_ not a mile high,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are,” said the King.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides, that’s not a\\r\\nregular rule: you invented it just now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider your\\r\\nverdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,” said the\\r\\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has just been\\r\\npicked up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s in it?” said the Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “but it seems to be a\\r\\nletter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it was written to\\r\\nnobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “in fact, there’s\\r\\nnothing written on the _outside_.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\\r\\nand added “It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another of the jurymen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “and that’s the queerest\\r\\nthing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)\\r\\n\\r\\n“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King. (The jury\\r\\nall brightened up again.)\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\\r\\ncan’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\\r\\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\\r\\nyour name like an honest man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\\r\\nclever thing the King had said that day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That _proves_ his guilt,” said the Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, you don’t even know\\r\\nwhat they’re about!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Read them,” said the King.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please\\r\\nyour Majesty?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go on till you\\r\\ncome to the end: then stop.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:—\\r\\n\\r\\n“They told me you had been to her,\\r\\n    And mentioned me to him:\\r\\nShe gave me a good character,\\r\\n    But said I could not swim.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sent them word I had not gone\\r\\n    (We know it to be true):\\r\\nIf she should push the matter on,\\r\\n    What would become of you?\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\\r\\n    You gave us three or more;\\r\\nThey all returned from him to you,\\r\\n    Though they were mine before.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I or she should chance to be\\r\\n    Involved in this affair,\\r\\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\\r\\n    Exactly as we were.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy notion was that you had been\\r\\n    (Before she had this fit)\\r\\nAn obstacle that came between\\r\\n    Him, and ourselves, and it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon’t let him know she liked them best,\\r\\n    For this must ever be\\r\\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\\r\\n    Between yourself and me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,” said the\\r\\nKing, rubbing his hands; “so now let the jury—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown so\\r\\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of\\r\\ninterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s\\r\\nan atom of meaning in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, “_She_ doesn’t believe there’s\\r\\nan atom of meaning in it,” but none of them attempted to explain the\\r\\npaper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “that saves a world of\\r\\ntrouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t\\r\\nknow,” he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\\r\\nthem with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\\r\\n“—_said I could not swim_—” you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning\\r\\nto the Knave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said. (Which he\\r\\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering over the\\r\\nverses to himself: “‘_We know it to be true_—’ that’s the jury, of\\r\\ncourse—‘_I gave her one, they gave him two_—’ why, that must be what he\\r\\ndid with the tarts, you know—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, it goes on ‘_they all returned from him to you_,’” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\\r\\ntarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\\r\\nagain—‘_before she had this fit_—’ you never had fits, my dear, I\\r\\nthink?” he said to the Queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\\r\\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\\r\\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\\r\\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\\r\\nas it lasted.)\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then the words don’t _fit_ you,” said the King, looking round the\\r\\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\\r\\nlaughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the King said, for\\r\\nabout the twentieth time that day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdict afterwards.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of having the\\r\\nsentence first!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t!” said Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\\r\\nmoved.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\\r\\nthis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\r\\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\r\\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\r\\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\r\\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\\r\\nhad!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she told her\\r\\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\\r\\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\\r\\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\\r\\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.”\\r\\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\r\\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\r\\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\\r\\nher wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\\r\\nand this was her dream:—\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\r\\nhands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\\r\\nlooking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\\r\\nsee that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\\r\\nthat _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\\r\\nseemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\\r\\nstrange creatures of her little sister’s dream.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\\r\\nfrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\\r\\ncould hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\r\\nshared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\r\\nordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\\r\\nwas sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\r\\naround it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\r\\nLizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\r\\nfilled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\r\\nTurtle.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\r\\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\r\\nwould change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\\r\\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\\r\\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\\r\\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\\r\\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\\r\\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\\r\\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\\r\\nTurtle’s heavy sobs.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\r\\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\r\\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\r\\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\\r\\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\\r\\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\\r\\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\\r\\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\\r\\ndays.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.

For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n']"

These apples were always counted, and about\\r\\nthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\\r\\nof them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\\r\\ngardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\\r\\neldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in\\r\\nthe morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was\\r\\nordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\\r\\nanother apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\\r\\nthe gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\\r\\nto him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\\r\\nunder the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\\r\\nnoise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\\r\\nit was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son\\r\\njumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;\\r\\nonly it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.\\r\\nThe golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the\\r\\ncouncil was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than\\r\\nall the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no\\r\\nuse to me, I must have the whole bird.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\\r\\nbird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\\r\\nwood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\\r\\nbow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me,\\r\\nfor I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and\\r\\nthat you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the\\r\\nevening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\\r\\nother, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\\r\\nthere, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\\r\\nto be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can\\r\\nsuch a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at\\r\\nthe fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\\r\\nran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\\r\\nthe village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\\r\\nsinging, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\\r\\nand poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby\\r\\nhouse, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,\\r\\nand ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\\r\\nwere heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\\r\\nto him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\\r\\nto the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\\r\\nthe merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\\r\\nwithstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\\r\\nhis country in the same manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\\r\\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\\r\\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\\r\\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\\r\\ncoming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\\r\\nnot rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\\r\\nthe same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\\r\\nattempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my\\r\\ntail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to\\r\\nrun, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\\r\\nwhistled in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and\\r\\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\\r\\nnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\\r\\nwas beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come\\r\\nto a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\\r\\nsnoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\\r\\non till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\\r\\nclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\\r\\nbird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\\r\\nyou will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\\r\\nyoung man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\\r\\ntheir hair whistled in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\\r\\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\\r\\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\\r\\nlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a\\r\\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so\\r\\nhe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.\\r\\nBut the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\\r\\nthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning\\r\\nthe court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\\r\\ndie, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\\r\\nswiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\\r\\ngiven him for his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\\r\\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now\\r\\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will\\r\\nstill, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as\\r\\nI bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the\\r\\nhorse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep\\r\\nand snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old\\r\\nleathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’\\r\\nThen the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock\\r\\nand stone till their hair whistled in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden\\r\\nsaddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity\\r\\nto put the leathern saddle upon it. ‘I will give him the good one,’\\r\\nsaid he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden saddle the\\r\\ngroom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took\\r\\nhim prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court\\r\\nto be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he\\r\\ncould bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the\\r\\nbird and the horse given him for his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why\\r\\ndid not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away\\r\\nboth the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go\\r\\nstraight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve\\r\\no’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\\r\\nand give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\\r\\nyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’\\r\\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\\r\\nand stone till their hair whistled again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\\r\\no’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the\\r\\nkiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears\\r\\nthat he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,\\r\\nbut she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last\\r\\nhe consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards\\r\\nawoke and he was taken prisoner again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never\\r\\nhave my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops\\r\\nthe view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the whole world\\r\\ncould not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had\\r\\ndone very little, the fox came and said. ‘Lie down and go to sleep; I\\r\\nwill work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;\\r\\nso he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was\\r\\nremoved he must give him the princess.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man\\r\\nand the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all\\r\\nthree, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ‘Ah!’ said the young man,\\r\\n‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done. When you come\\r\\nto the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here\\r\\nshe is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden\\r\\nhorse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of\\r\\nthem; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on\\r\\nto the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as\\r\\nfast as you can.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAll went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where\\r\\nthe bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\\r\\nride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\\r\\nhorse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that\\r\\nyou want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and\\r\\nwhen you get it into your hand, ride away.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\\r\\nprincess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox\\r\\ncame, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the\\r\\nyoung man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give\\r\\nyou good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,\\r\\nand sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went. ‘Well,’\\r\\nthought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\\r\\nhe had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and\\r\\nuproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men\\r\\nare going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\\r\\nhis brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any\\r\\nway be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his\\r\\nmoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to\\r\\nthink about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\\r\\ngiven up, and went on with him towards their home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\\r\\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the\\r\\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,\\r\\n‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\\r\\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\\r\\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\\r\\nhome to the king their master, and said. ‘All this have we won by our\\r\\nlabour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\\r\\neat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was\\r\\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\\r\\nthat he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,\\r\\nand scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\\r\\nhave befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\\r\\nof my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\\r\\nto him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill\\r\\nyou, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor\\r\\nman, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the\\r\\ndoors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\\r\\nleft off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his\\r\\nbrothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\\r\\nprincess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to\\r\\nhis kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\\r\\nmet him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\\r\\noff his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\\r\\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\\r\\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHANS IN LUCK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\\r\\nright--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\\r\\nswans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\\r\\nwill always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\\r\\nmuch the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as\\r\\nthey think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it\\r\\nknow about the matter?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had\\r\\nworked hard for his master. At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I\\r\\nmust go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\\r\\nand let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good\\r\\nservant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump\\r\\nof silver as big as his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\\r\\nthrew it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he\\r\\nwent lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\\r\\ntrotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a\\r\\nfine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy\\r\\nas if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\\r\\nstones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did\\r\\nnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,\\r\\nfriend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to\\r\\ncarry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up\\r\\nmy head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say\\r\\nof making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ‘I will give you my horse,\\r\\nand you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\\r\\ntrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my\\r\\nheart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\\r\\nthing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’\\r\\nHowever, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\\r\\nthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When\\r\\nyou want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\\r\\n“Jip!”’\\r\\n\\r\\nHans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\\r\\nelbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\\r\\nminute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘No care and no sorrow,\\r\\n  A fig for the morrow!\\r\\n  We’ll laugh and be merry,\\r\\n  Sing neigh down derry!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\\r\\nsmacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and\\r\\nbefore Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\\r\\nback by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\\r\\nwas coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to\\r\\nhimself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\\r\\nshepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\\r\\na beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\\r\\nhis neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\\r\\ndeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\\r\\nspoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\\r\\nnot very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that\\r\\ncow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\\r\\ninto the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said\\r\\nthe shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\\r\\nhorse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\\r\\nmyself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ‘What a noble heart that good man\\r\\nhas!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\\r\\nand the cow good morning, and away he rode.\\r\\n\\r\\nHans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\\r\\nthen drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\\r\\none. ‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\\r\\nable to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\\r\\nit; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\\r\\ncan I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\\r\\nbread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had\\r\\nrested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s\\r\\nvillage. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\\r\\nlast, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\\r\\nan hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\\r\\nclave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought\\r\\nhe; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the\\r\\nstump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\\r\\nwas to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\\r\\nhim milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had\\r\\nnot thought of looking to that.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\\r\\nclumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\\r\\nlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\\r\\nlay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\\r\\npig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the\\r\\nbutcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he\\r\\nwas dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then\\r\\nthe butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh\\r\\nyourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old\\r\\nbeast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said\\r\\nHans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and\\r\\ngive me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate\\r\\ncow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like\\r\\nthat fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\\r\\nsomething with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said\\r\\nthe butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\\r\\nneighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\\r\\npig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’\\r\\nsaid Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\\r\\nwheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\\r\\nits leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\\r\\nwith some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.\\r\\nHow could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\\r\\nlast got?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The\\r\\ncountryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;\\r\\nand Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\\r\\nhow all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then\\r\\nbegan to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\\r\\nchristening. ‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\\r\\nweeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\\r\\nit has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in\\r\\nhis hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the\\r\\ncountryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he,\\r\\n‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing\\r\\nyou a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I\\r\\njust came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was\\r\\ndreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig. If\\r\\nyou have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least\\r\\nthey will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?’\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Hans was sadly frightened. ‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out\\r\\nof this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\\r\\nbut he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this\\r\\ncountry better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought\\r\\nto have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat\\r\\ngoose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\\r\\nthat. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then\\r\\nhe took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\\r\\nwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’\\r\\nthought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t care whose pig\\r\\nit is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I\\r\\nhave much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;\\r\\nthen the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\\r\\nare all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,\\r\\nand then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my\\r\\nmother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,\\r\\nworking and singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘O’er hill and o’er dale\\r\\n  So happy I roam,\\r\\n  Work light and live well,\\r\\n  All the world is my home;\\r\\n  Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’\\r\\n\\r\\nHans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be well\\r\\noff, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’ ‘Yes,’ said the\\r\\nother, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\\r\\ninto his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that\\r\\nbeautiful goose?’ ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And where\\r\\ndid you get the pig?’ ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’ ‘I gave a\\r\\nhorse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’ ‘I gave a lump of silver as big as my\\r\\nhead for it.’ ‘And the silver?’ ‘Oh! I worked hard for that seven long\\r\\nyears.’ ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said the grinder,\\r\\n‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand\\r\\nin it, your fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be\\r\\nmanaged?’ ‘How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’ said the other;\\r\\n‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one\\r\\nthat is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the\\r\\nvalue of your goose for it--will you buy?’ ‘How can you ask?’ said\\r\\nHans; ‘I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money\\r\\nwhenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there’s\\r\\nthe goose.’ ‘Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone\\r\\nthat lay by his side, ‘this is a most capital stone; do but work it well\\r\\nenough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\\r\\nsparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been born\\r\\nin a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.\\r\\nPeople are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in\\r\\nletting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his\\r\\nlast penny in his joy at getting the cow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\\r\\ndragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\\r\\nwater, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\\r\\nthe bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\\r\\nlittle, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\\r\\nup and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,\\r\\nwith tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,\\r\\nthe ugly heavy stone.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he\\r\\ngot with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till\\r\\nhe reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the road to\\r\\ngood luck was.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJORINDA AND JORINDEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\\r\\nwood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take\\r\\nany shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of\\r\\nan owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always\\r\\nbecame an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred\\r\\npaces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step\\r\\ntill she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given\\r\\nher his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came\\r\\nwithin that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her\\r\\ninto a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were\\r\\nseven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with\\r\\nbeautiful birds in them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier\\r\\nthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\\r\\nlad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\\r\\nto be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be\\r\\nalone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near\\r\\nto the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the\\r\\nsetting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon\\r\\nthe green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall\\r\\nbirches.\\r\\n\\r\\nJorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\\r\\nboth felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\\r\\nparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when\\r\\nthey looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves\\r\\nat a loss to know what path to take.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\\r\\nthe hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\\r\\nbushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\\r\\nwalls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.\\r\\nJorinda was just singing,\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\\r\\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\\r\\n  He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,\\r\\n  Well-a-day!’\\r\\n\\r\\nwhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\\r\\nbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\\r\\nwith a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\\r\\nround them, and three times screamed:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’\\r\\n\\r\\nJorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\\r\\nweep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;\\r\\nthe gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the\\r\\nold fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and\\r\\nchin that almost met one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away\\r\\nwith it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but\\r\\nwhat could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot\\r\\nwhere he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse\\r\\nvoice:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Till the prisoner is fast,\\r\\n  And her doom is cast,\\r\\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\\r\\n  When the charm is around her,\\r\\n  And the spell has bound her,\\r\\n  Hie away! away!’\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\\r\\nbefore the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but\\r\\nshe laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she\\r\\nwent her way.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what\\r\\nwill become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to\\r\\na strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time\\r\\ndid he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,\\r\\nbut all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\\r\\nand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\\r\\nplucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\\r\\nthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\\r\\nfound his Jorinda again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for\\r\\nthis pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but\\r\\non the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple\\r\\nflower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly\\r\\npearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and\\r\\nnight, till he came again to the castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\\r\\nfixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.\\r\\nJorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with\\r\\nthe flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,\\r\\nand listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the\\r\\nchamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in\\r\\nthe seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and\\r\\nscreamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for\\r\\nthe flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at\\r\\nthe birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then\\r\\nshould he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to\\r\\ndo, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the\\r\\nbest of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched\\r\\nthe cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her\\r\\narms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when\\r\\nthey walked together in the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\\r\\ntook their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\\r\\nmarried, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\\r\\nother lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s\\r\\ncages by themselves, much longer than they liked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him\\r\\na great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\\r\\nunfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\\r\\nbegan to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some\\r\\nmischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey\\r\\ntowards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\\r\\nroadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so, my\\r\\nfriend?’ said the ass. ‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to\\r\\nknock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make\\r\\nmyself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to\\r\\nearn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great\\r\\ncity to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can\\r\\ndo in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\\r\\nroad and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,\\r\\n‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’\\r\\nsaid the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in\\r\\ndanger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\\r\\nease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\\r\\nlaid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\\r\\nenough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’\\r\\n‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are\\r\\na good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat\\r\\nwas pleased with the thought, and joined the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\\r\\nperched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\\r\\n‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\\r\\nis all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that\\r\\nwe should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\\r\\nthe cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\\r\\nhead tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\\r\\non Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master\\r\\nChanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\\r\\nyour head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\\r\\nmay get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my\\r\\nheart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\\r\\nnight came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid\\r\\nthemselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\\r\\nbranches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\\r\\nshould be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to\\r\\nhis custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\\r\\nsee that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something\\r\\nbright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a\\r\\nhouse no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said\\r\\nthe ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the\\r\\nbest in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the\\r\\nworse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together\\r\\ntowards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew\\r\\nnear it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a\\r\\nhouse in which a gang of robbers lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\\r\\npeeped in. ‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What\\r\\ndo I see?’ replied the ass. ‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of\\r\\ngood things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would\\r\\nbe a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we\\r\\ncould only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive\\r\\nto get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed\\r\\nhimself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the\\r\\nwindow; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s\\r\\nshoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head. When\\r\\nall was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass\\r\\nbrayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then\\r\\nthey all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into\\r\\nthe room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The\\r\\nrobbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,\\r\\nhad now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\\r\\nand scampered away as fast as they could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\\r\\nthe robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected\\r\\nto eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they\\r\\nput out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to\\r\\nhis own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in\\r\\nthe yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the\\r\\ncat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the\\r\\ncock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all\\r\\nrather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\\r\\nout and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\\r\\ntoo great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than\\r\\nthe rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he\\r\\nmarched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\\r\\norder to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\\r\\nthe cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\\r\\nlight it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\\r\\nand spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away\\r\\nhe ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the\\r\\nleg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the\\r\\ncock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At\\r\\nthis the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told\\r\\nthe captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at\\r\\nhim and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a\\r\\nknife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him\\r\\nin the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a\\r\\nclub, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,\\r\\n‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go\\r\\nback to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters\\r\\nthat they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at\\r\\nthis very day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOLD SULTAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,\\r\\nand had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife\\r\\nwere standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot\\r\\nold Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife\\r\\nsaid, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a\\r\\ngreat many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of\\r\\nhis days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not\\r\\na tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to\\r\\nbe sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;\\r\\ntomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\\r\\nand his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think\\r\\ntomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good\\r\\nfriend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,\\r\\nand how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself\\r\\neasy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,\\r\\nyou know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the\\r\\nfield; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\\r\\nbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie\\r\\ndown close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come\\r\\nout of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as\\r\\nyou can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they\\r\\nwill think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you\\r\\nthat they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this\\r\\nplan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the\\r\\nchild a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan\\r\\nsoon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master\\r\\nand mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old\\r\\nSultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live\\r\\nand be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and\\r\\ngive him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on\\r\\nas long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he\\r\\ncould wish for.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my\\r\\ngood fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way\\r\\nwhen I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’\\r\\nsaid the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf\\r\\nthought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But\\r\\nSultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait\\r\\nfor him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for\\r\\na good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed\\r\\nhis locks for him finely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and\\r\\nswore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the\\r\\nboar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now\\r\\nSultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old\\r\\nthree-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped\\r\\nalong with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\\r\\nespied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing\\r\\nstraight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to\\r\\nfight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up\\r\\na stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of\\r\\nfighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped\\r\\nup into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and\\r\\nwondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden\\r\\nhimself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\\r\\nthem a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\\r\\nmouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\\r\\nup and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there\\r\\nsits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf\\r\\nsitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\\r\\nand would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\\r\\nhimself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\\r\\nof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and\\r\\nthat it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.\\r\\nWhen she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\\r\\nobserving it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\\r\\na burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw\\r\\nbegan and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal\\r\\nreplied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\\r\\nby sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\\r\\nburnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,\\r\\nbut if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\\r\\ninto broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better\\r\\nfate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has\\r\\ndestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\\r\\nonce, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped\\r\\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\\r\\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\\r\\nrepair to a foreign country.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\\r\\ntogether. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\\r\\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\\r\\nit. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight\\r\\nacross, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw\\r\\ntherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\\r\\nwho was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\\r\\nnewly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\\r\\nwater rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\\r\\nand ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\\r\\ntwo pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed\\r\\nwhen she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had\\r\\nprudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\\r\\nwas unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would\\r\\nhave been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\\r\\nwas travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.\\r\\nAs he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\\r\\nand sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\\r\\ntailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBRIAR ROSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\\r\\nwhere there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had\\r\\nplenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of\\r\\ngood things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but\\r\\nthough they had been married many years they had no children, and this\\r\\ngrieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking\\r\\nby the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor\\r\\nlittle fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping\\r\\nand nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little\\r\\nfish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away\\r\\nit lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,\\r\\nand it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will\\r\\nsoon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to\\r\\npass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king\\r\\ncould not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great\\r\\nfeast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked\\r\\nhis kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen\\r\\nsaid, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good\\r\\nto our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;\\r\\nbut as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat\\r\\nout of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.\\r\\nSo twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red\\r\\nshoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:\\r\\nand after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all\\r\\ntheir best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another\\r\\nbeauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\\r\\nthe courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\\r\\ncome, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\\r\\nbroomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.\\r\\nNow, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\\r\\nscolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\\r\\nrevenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth\\r\\nyear, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of\\r\\nthe friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and\\r\\nsaid that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\\r\\nmischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle\\r\\nwounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\\r\\nhundred years.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\\r\\nthe threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom\\r\\nshould be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven\\r\\nfairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so\\r\\nbeautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew\\r\\nher loved her.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king\\r\\nand queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she\\r\\nroved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till\\r\\nat last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase\\r\\nending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when\\r\\nshe turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning\\r\\naway very busily. ‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what\\r\\nare you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her\\r\\nhead, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that\\r\\nlittle thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle\\r\\nand began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the\\r\\nfairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell\\r\\ndown lifeless on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and\\r\\nthe king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,\\r\\nfell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in\\r\\nthe court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon\\r\\nthe walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to\\r\\nsleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a\\r\\ngoose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was\\r\\nat that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box\\r\\non the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell\\r\\nasleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the\\r\\njug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\\r\\nbecame higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded\\r\\nand hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But\\r\\nthere went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar\\r\\nRose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to\\r\\ntime, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket\\r\\ninto the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the\\r\\nthorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there\\r\\nthey stuck fast, and died wretchedly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an\\r\\nold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\\r\\npalace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\\r\\nlay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard\\r\\nfrom his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to\\r\\nbreak through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and\\r\\ndied. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I\\r\\nwill go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but\\r\\nhe was bent upon going.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\\r\\nto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\\r\\nwhich he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.\\r\\nThen he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs\\r\\nasleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat\\r\\nthe pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he\\r\\ncame into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit\\r\\nwas standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going\\r\\nto drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be\\r\\nplucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as\\r\\nif she was going to beat the boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\\r\\nevery breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\\r\\nthe door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\\r\\nfast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he\\r\\ncould not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\\r\\nBut the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\\r\\nupon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\\r\\nawoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.\\r\\nAnd the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\\r\\npigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and\\r\\nflew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in\\r\\nthe kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,\\r\\nwith the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his\\r\\ndraught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave\\r\\nthe boy the box on his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast\\r\\nwas given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE DOG AND THE SPARROW\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\\r\\nsuffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he\\r\\ntook to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.\\r\\nOn the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,\\r\\nmy friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have\\r\\nnothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me\\r\\ninto the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they\\r\\nwent together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,\\r\\nthe sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you\\r\\ndown a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having\\r\\nfirst looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she\\r\\npecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,\\r\\ntill at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled\\r\\naway with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said\\r\\nthe sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to\\r\\nthe next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had\\r\\neaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you\\r\\nhad enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should\\r\\nlike to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’\\r\\nsaid the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him\\r\\nto a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till\\r\\nthey fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to\\r\\nanother shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the\\r\\nsparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and\\r\\nnow let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went\\r\\nout upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone\\r\\nfar before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a\\r\\nnap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime\\r\\nI will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the\\r\\nroad, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with\\r\\na cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The\\r\\nsparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would\\r\\ngo on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called\\r\\nout, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the\\r\\ncarter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!\\r\\nwhat can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\\r\\ndog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the\\r\\nsparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now\\r\\nmind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’\\r\\n‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’\\r\\nand passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and\\r\\npecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then\\r\\nall the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked\\r\\nround, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.\\r\\n‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said\\r\\nthe sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and\\r\\npecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,\\r\\nhe drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill\\r\\nher; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head\\r\\nwith such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’\\r\\ncried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter\\r\\nwent on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the\\r\\ncart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine\\r\\nran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch\\r\\nthat I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and\\r\\nperched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The\\r\\ncarter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she\\r\\nflew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the\\r\\nspot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said\\r\\nthe sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him\\r\\ntoo. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or\\r\\ncaring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his\\r\\nthird horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I\\r\\nam!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew\\r\\naway; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The\\r\\ncarter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home\\r\\noverflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what\\r\\nill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three\\r\\ndead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into\\r\\nthe house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am\\r\\nsure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it\\r\\nup at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of\\r\\nbirds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the\\r\\nmidst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw\\r\\nthat the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the\\r\\nsparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down\\r\\ninto his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat\\r\\nhimself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat\\r\\non the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost\\r\\nthee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,\\r\\nand threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the\\r\\nwindow. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and\\r\\ncried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and\\r\\nblind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he\\r\\ncleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter\\r\\nand his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,\\r\\nglasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without\\r\\ntouching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the\\r\\nwife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting\\r\\nher off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat\\r\\nher.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck\\r\\nand cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he\\r\\ncould wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,\\r\\nstrike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but\\r\\nshe missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down\\r\\ndead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in\\r\\ntwelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\\r\\nshut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite\\r\\nworn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody\\r\\ncould find out how it happened, or where they had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\\r\\ndiscover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\\r\\ndanced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\\r\\nwife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not\\r\\nsucceed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nA king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was\\r\\ntaken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their\\r\\ntwelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;\\r\\nand, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door\\r\\nof his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and\\r\\nwhen he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been\\r\\ndancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing\\r\\nhappened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be\\r\\ncut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,\\r\\nand all lost their lives in the same manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle\\r\\nand could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\\r\\nreigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\\r\\nwho asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or\\r\\nwhat I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very\\r\\nwell to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time\\r\\nI might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard\\r\\ntask: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the\\r\\nprincesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves\\r\\nyou pretend to be fast asleep.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on\\r\\nyou will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\\r\\nprincesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good\\r\\ncounsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said\\r\\nhe was willing to undertake the task.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\\r\\nfine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\\r\\nto the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\\r\\nthe princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\\r\\naway secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself\\r\\ndown on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\\r\\nhe was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\\r\\nheartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser\\r\\nthing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened\\r\\ntheir drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and\\r\\ndressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager\\r\\nto begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while\\r\\nyou are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will\\r\\nbefall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid;\\r\\nhave you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain?\\r\\nAnd as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping\\r\\ndraught, he would have slept soundly enough.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\\r\\nsnored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were\\r\\nquite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,\\r\\nand the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier\\r\\nsaw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest\\r\\nleading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put\\r\\non the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;\\r\\nbut in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest\\r\\nprincess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone\\r\\ntook hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is\\r\\nnothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the\\r\\nbottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and\\r\\nthe leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.\\r\\nThe soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke\\r\\noff a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the\\r\\nyoungest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you\\r\\nhear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It\\r\\nis only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\\r\\ngold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\\r\\ndiamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\\r\\nwas a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\\r\\nthe eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.\\r\\nSo they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\\r\\nlake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\\r\\nwho seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\\r\\nthe same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the\\r\\nprince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\\r\\nsaid, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\\r\\nwe do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat\\r\\nseems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the\\r\\nprincess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from\\r\\nwhich came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,\\r\\nand went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and\\r\\nthe soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and\\r\\nwhen any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it\\r\\nall up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,\\r\\ntoo, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always\\r\\nsilenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then\\r\\nall their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.\\r\\nThe princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the\\r\\nsoldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the\\r\\nopposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising\\r\\nto come again the next night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,\\r\\nand laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very\\r\\nmuch tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all\\r\\nis quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine\\r\\nclothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the\\r\\nsoldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more\\r\\nof this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;\\r\\nand every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time\\r\\ntill their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,\\r\\non the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a\\r\\ntoken of where he had been.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken\\r\\nbefore the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the\\r\\ntwelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would\\r\\nsay. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at\\r\\nnight?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And\\r\\nthen he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three\\r\\nbranches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king\\r\\ncalled for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said\\r\\nwas true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was\\r\\nof no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king\\r\\nasked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he\\r\\nanswered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they\\r\\nwere married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s\\r\\nheir.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close\\r\\nby the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and\\r\\none day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling\\r\\nwaves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away\\r\\ndeep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.\\r\\nBut the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an\\r\\nenchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’\\r\\nsaid the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will\\r\\nhave nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon\\r\\nas you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted\\r\\nstraight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him\\r\\non the wave.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how\\r\\nhe had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted\\r\\nprince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. ‘Did not\\r\\nyou ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here,\\r\\nin this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug\\r\\nlittle cottage.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\\r\\nseashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\\r\\ngreen. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will?\\r\\nWhat does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when\\r\\nI had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let\\r\\nyou go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants\\r\\na snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the\\r\\ncottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the\\r\\ndoor of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is\\r\\nnot this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a\\r\\nparlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there\\r\\nwas a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and\\r\\nthere was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said the\\r\\nfisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at\\r\\nleast,’ said his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\\r\\n‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\\r\\ncourtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to\\r\\nhave a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him\\r\\nto give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to\\r\\nhim again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this\\r\\npretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it\\r\\nvery willingly, I know; go along and try!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to\\r\\nthe sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went\\r\\nclose to the edge of the waves, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the man,\\r\\ndolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’\\r\\nsaid the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went\\r\\nthe fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great\\r\\ncastle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into\\r\\nthe castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the\\r\\nrooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and\\r\\nbehind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a\\r\\nmile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the\\r\\ncourtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we\\r\\nwill live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of\\r\\nour lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,\\r\\nbefore we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and\\r\\nshe jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband,\\r\\nand bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’\\r\\nsaid the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.’\\r\\n‘Then I will,’ said she. ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you\\r\\nbe king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say\\r\\nno more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the man went away\\r\\nquite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time\\r\\nthe sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves\\r\\nand the ridges of foam as he cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Alas!’ said the poor\\r\\nman, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king\\r\\nalready.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw\\r\\na troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when\\r\\nhe went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,\\r\\nwith a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six\\r\\nfair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, wife,’ said the\\r\\nfisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had\\r\\nlooked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife! what a fine thing it\\r\\nis to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long\\r\\nas we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long\\r\\ntime. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I\\r\\nthink I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to\\r\\nbe emperor?’ said the fisherman. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!\\r\\nI say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish\\r\\ncannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for\\r\\nsuch a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go\\r\\nat once!’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\\r\\n‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\\r\\ntired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He\\r\\nsoon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and\\r\\na mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he\\r\\nwent as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,\\r\\n‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor\\r\\nalready.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\\r\\nsitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on\\r\\nher head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards\\r\\nand attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the\\r\\ntallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And\\r\\nbefore her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went\\r\\nup to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am\\r\\nemperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing\\r\\nit is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being\\r\\nemperor? I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be\\r\\npope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said\\r\\nshe, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the\\r\\nfish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make\\r\\nan emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging\\r\\nand the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were\\r\\nin trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the\\r\\nmiddle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards\\r\\nthe south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight\\r\\nthe fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his\\r\\nknees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my\\r\\nwife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne\\r\\nthat was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and\\r\\naround her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side\\r\\nof her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as\\r\\nlarge as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no\\r\\nlarger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked\\r\\nat all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’\\r\\n‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now\\r\\nyou must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about\\r\\nthat,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not\\r\\nsleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she\\r\\nwas dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought she,\\r\\nas she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot\\r\\nprevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened\\r\\nher husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must\\r\\nbe lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the\\r\\nthought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.\\r\\n‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’\\r\\nsaid she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my\\r\\nleave. Go to the fish at once!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to\\r\\nthe shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks\\r\\nshook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the\\r\\nlightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in\\r\\nthe sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of\\r\\nwhite foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,\\r\\nand cried out, as well as he could:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘O man of the sea!\\r\\n  Hearken to me!\\r\\n  My wife Ilsabill\\r\\n  Will have her own will,\\r\\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to\\r\\nbe lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty\\r\\nagain.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there they live to this very day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\\r\\nand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother\\r\\nwolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’\\r\\nsaid the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was\\r\\nthe willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very\\r\\nmuch like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not\\r\\ndone quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until\\r\\nthe Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in\\r\\nher beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young\\r\\nones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him\\r\\nback by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady\\r\\nQueen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the\\r\\nnest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he\\r\\nhad seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it\\r\\nagain. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw\\r\\nfive or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried\\r\\nthe bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you\\r\\nare disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were\\r\\nfrightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are\\r\\nhonest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\\r\\nholes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\\r\\nwhen their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as\\r\\ntouch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\\r\\nsettled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been\\r\\nhere and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall\\r\\nbe punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and\\r\\ncalled in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall\\r\\nsuffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was\\r\\nannounced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\\r\\npart in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\\r\\ncontained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\\r\\nair, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and\\r\\nflies had to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies\\r\\nto discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was\\r\\nthe most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,\\r\\nand hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be\\r\\nannounced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him\\r\\nand said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be\\r\\ngeneral and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we\\r\\nagree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long\\r\\nbushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift\\r\\nmy tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I\\r\\nlet it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard\\r\\nthat, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest\\r\\ndetail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,\\r\\nall the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the\\r\\nearth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through\\r\\nthe air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one\\r\\nwas uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each\\r\\nother. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle\\r\\nbeneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt\\r\\nthe first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but\\r\\nhe bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second\\r\\nsting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could\\r\\nhold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When\\r\\nthe animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each\\r\\ninto his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\\r\\n‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won\\r\\nthe battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear\\r\\nmust come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable\\r\\nchildren, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the\\r\\nbear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my\\r\\nchildren, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall\\r\\nbe broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged\\r\\ntheir pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat\\r\\ndown together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the\\r\\nnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FROG-PRINCE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went\\r\\nout to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool\\r\\nspring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down\\r\\nto rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her\\r\\nfavourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and\\r\\ncatching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that\\r\\nshe missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\\r\\nalong upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The\\r\\nprincess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\\r\\ndeep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail\\r\\nher loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would\\r\\ngive all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the\\r\\nworld.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\\r\\n‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you\\r\\ndo for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’\\r\\nThe frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;\\r\\nbut if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off\\r\\nyour golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball\\r\\nagain.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is\\r\\ntalking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though\\r\\nhe may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he\\r\\nshall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will\\r\\nbring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head\\r\\ndown, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came\\r\\nup again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\\r\\nspring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\\r\\nit up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\\r\\nnever thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.\\r\\nThe frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\\r\\nsaid,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\\r\\nstrange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\\r\\nmarble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\\r\\ndoor, and a little voice cried out and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\\r\\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\\r\\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\\r\\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw\\r\\nthe frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly\\r\\nfrightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\\r\\nseat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\\r\\nasked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at\\r\\nthe door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I\\r\\ntold him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never\\r\\nget out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come\\r\\nin.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\\r\\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\\r\\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\\r\\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word\\r\\nyou must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped\\r\\ninto the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the\\r\\nbottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where\\r\\nthe princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,\\r\\n‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog\\r\\nsaid, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This\\r\\nshe did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am\\r\\ntired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,\\r\\nthough very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\\r\\npillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was\\r\\nlight he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.\\r\\n‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be\\r\\ntroubled with him no more.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\\r\\ntapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\\r\\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\\r\\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\\r\\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\\r\\nher pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did\\r\\nthe same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\\r\\nastonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\\r\\nwith the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\\r\\nof her bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\\r\\nchanged him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\\r\\nsome princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\\r\\nher plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the\\r\\nprince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for\\r\\nbut that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will\\r\\nmarry you, and love you as long as you live.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to\\r\\nall this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\\r\\nhorses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind\\r\\nthe coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed\\r\\nthe misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\\r\\nbitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\\r\\nhorses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s\\r\\nkingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\\r\\nmany years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\\r\\nto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\\r\\nlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\\r\\n‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\\r\\nfrom hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture\\r\\neverywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice\\r\\nwas followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\\r\\nto put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no\\r\\nplace where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\\r\\ndares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,\\r\\nand not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was\\r\\nplaced in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\\r\\nyearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,\\r\\nlittle mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\\r\\nasked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\\r\\nhim over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look\\r\\nafter the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all\\r\\nmeans go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I\\r\\nshould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,\\r\\nhowever, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\\r\\nbe godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\\r\\nbegan to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a\\r\\nwalk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\\r\\nstretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\\r\\nof the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.\\r\\n‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a\\r\\nmerry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they\\r\\ngive the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried\\r\\nthe mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\\r\\nyour family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse\\r\\nthan Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to\\r\\nthe mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for\\r\\na day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a\\r\\nwhite ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,\\r\\nbut the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured\\r\\nhalf the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to\\r\\noneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When\\r\\nshe went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’\\r\\n‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I\\r\\nnever heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the\\r\\ncalendar!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good\\r\\nthings go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.\\r\\nThe child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\\r\\nexception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\\r\\nhappens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!\\r\\nHalf-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me\\r\\nvery thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey\\r\\nfur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because\\r\\nyou do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse\\r\\ncleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\\r\\nemptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some\\r\\npeace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\\r\\nhome till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\\r\\nthe third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the\\r\\ncat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the\\r\\nmost suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;\\r\\nwhat can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\\r\\ndown to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\\r\\nwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\\r\\noutside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,\\r\\nwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\\r\\nshall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much\\r\\nas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\\r\\nwindow.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\\r\\nfat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the\\r\\nmouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true\\r\\nfriend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First\\r\\ntop off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the\\r\\ncat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on\\r\\nthe poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\\r\\non her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of\\r\\nthe world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOOSE-GIRL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their\\r\\nonly child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her\\r\\nmother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good\\r\\nfairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch\\r\\nover her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\\r\\ngreat way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she\\r\\ngot ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her\\r\\nmother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and\\r\\nsilver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a\\r\\nroyal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give\\r\\nher into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.\\r\\nNow the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,\\r\\nand could speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\\r\\nbed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,\\r\\nand gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for\\r\\nit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took\\r\\na sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into\\r\\nher bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\\r\\nbridegroom’s kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\\r\\nfeel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch\\r\\nme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\\r\\ndrink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and\\r\\nstoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any\\r\\nlonger.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the\\r\\nlittle brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out\\r\\nher golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’\\r\\nAnd the lock answered her, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\\r\\nmaid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\\r\\nthe sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\\r\\nand at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude\\r\\nspeech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\\r\\nmy golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily\\r\\nthan before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’\\r\\nThen the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay\\r\\ndown, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,\\r\\n‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\\r\\nand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did\\r\\nnot see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the\\r\\ncharm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that\\r\\nshe had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would\\r\\nhave got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,\\r\\nand you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her\\r\\nhorse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her\\r\\nmaid’s shabby ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\\r\\nservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\\r\\nhappened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the\\r\\nother horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the\\r\\nroyal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\\r\\nmeet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\\r\\nwho was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;\\r\\nbut the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\\r\\namused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\\r\\ngoing on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,\\r\\nand too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\\r\\nto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left\\r\\nstanding in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her\\r\\ncompany on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do,\\r\\nthat she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think\\r\\nof any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes\\r\\ncare of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad,\\r\\nthat the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was\\r\\nCurdken.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one\\r\\npiece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of\\r\\nyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\\r\\nwas very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,\\r\\nshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and\\r\\ntell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the\\r\\nfaithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she\\r\\nwept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large\\r\\ndark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning\\r\\nand evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the\\r\\nslaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and\\r\\nnailed it up under the dark gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\\r\\nshe said sorrowfully:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\\r\\n\\r\\nand the head answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\r\\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she\\r\\ncame to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\\r\\nwaving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\\r\\nsaw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the\\r\\nlocks out, but she cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\\r\\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let him after it go!\\r\\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\\r\\n  Away be it whirl’d\\r\\n  Till the silvery locks\\r\\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and\\r\\naway it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\\r\\nit; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her\\r\\nhair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,\\r\\nand would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it\\r\\ngrew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\\r\\ngirl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\\r\\n\\r\\nand the head answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\r\\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began\\r\\nto comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to\\r\\ntake hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\\r\\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let him after it go!\\r\\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\\r\\n  Away be it whirl’d\\r\\n  Till the silvery locks\\r\\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\\r\\nover the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\\r\\nhe came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they\\r\\nwatched the geese till it grew dark.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any\\r\\nlonger.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she\\r\\ndoes nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him\\r\\nwhat had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through\\r\\nthe dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head\\r\\nof a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\\r\\n\\r\\nand the head answers:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\\r\\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\\r\\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\\r\\nwhere the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\\r\\nto run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the\\r\\nold king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning\\r\\ncame, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke\\r\\nto Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and\\r\\nhid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own\\r\\neyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,\\r\\nshe let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her\\r\\nsay:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\\r\\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\\r\\n  Let him after it go!\\r\\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\\r\\n  Away be it whirl’d\\r\\n  Till the silvery locks\\r\\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away\\r\\nwent Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\\r\\nhair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and\\r\\nwhen the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,\\r\\nand asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That\\r\\nI must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told\\r\\nhim all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very\\r\\nlucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered\\r\\nroyal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was\\r\\nso beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a\\r\\nfalse bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true\\r\\nbride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and\\r\\nheard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to\\r\\nthe false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all\\r\\nhis court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one\\r\\nside, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her\\r\\nbeauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all\\r\\nlike the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\\r\\nhe would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\\r\\nprincess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\\r\\ntrue waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would\\r\\nbehave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she\\r\\nshould be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that\\r\\ntwo white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to\\r\\nstreet till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as\\r\\nthou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young\\r\\nking was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the\\r\\nkingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came\\r\\nto see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\\r\\n‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\\r\\nbefore the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said\\r\\nPartlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\\r\\nthere till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\\r\\nnuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,\\r\\nI do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not\\r\\nbecome them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little\\r\\ncarriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into\\r\\nit and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her\\r\\nhome. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do;\\r\\nI had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman,\\r\\nif you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came\\r\\nquacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have\\r\\nyou in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon\\r\\nthat she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no\\r\\ncoward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely\\r\\nthat she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her\\r\\nupon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she\\r\\nagreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now,\\r\\nduck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good\\r\\npace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\\r\\nwalking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’\\r\\nand said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\\r\\ndirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\\r\\nfriend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\\r\\ndrinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore\\r\\nthat the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their\\r\\ncarriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not\\r\\nlikely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them\\r\\npromise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to\\r\\ntread on Partlet’s toes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\\r\\nthe dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\\r\\ndeal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\\r\\nquarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\\r\\nhouse was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\\r\\nhowever, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\\r\\nhad laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\\r\\nthe habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\\r\\nthey bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\\r\\nstirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\\r\\negg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\\r\\nfireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,\\r\\nand seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair\\r\\nand the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept\\r\\naway as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open\\r\\nair in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran\\r\\nclose by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\\r\\nto wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he\\r\\nwalked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he\\r\\nstirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.\\r\\n‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my\\r\\nhead this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his\\r\\neasy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the\\r\\npain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,\\r\\nsuspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look\\r\\nafter them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again\\r\\nwould take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no\\r\\nreckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\\r\\nso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\\r\\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\\r\\nand away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where\\r\\nare you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘All on our way\\r\\n  A visit to pay\\r\\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my\\r\\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\\r\\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\\r\\n  Now, mice, be ready,\\r\\n  And, wheels, run steady!\\r\\n  For we are going a visit to pay\\r\\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\\r\\nChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice\\r\\ndrew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\\r\\nupon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\\r\\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\\r\\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\\r\\nup in the towel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\\r\\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\\r\\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\\r\\nwhen he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\\r\\nover his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his\\r\\nsupper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\\r\\nhis cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\\r\\nrun out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\\r\\ndown on his head, and killed him on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\\r\\nto eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\\r\\nshould be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large\\r\\nnut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\\r\\nherself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\\r\\nstuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\\r\\nChanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\\r\\nshall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\\r\\nwill be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,\\r\\nand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to\\r\\nthe bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\\r\\nthe river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\\r\\nlies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride\\r\\nsaid, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\\r\\nin the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\\r\\nfrom the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\\r\\nthe bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\\r\\nthe river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\\r\\nPartlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\\r\\nquite dead, and never moved any more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\\r\\ncame and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little\\r\\nhearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\\r\\nthemselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they\\r\\nmet the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ‘To bury my\\r\\nPartlet,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but\\r\\nyou must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then\\r\\nthe fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and\\r\\nall the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get\\r\\nover?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,\\r\\nand you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the\\r\\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\\r\\nand were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came\\r\\nand said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\\r\\nshall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed\\r\\nso clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\\r\\nstream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly\\r\\noffered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;\\r\\nand this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and\\r\\nmanaged to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,\\r\\nwho were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water\\r\\nand were all carried away by the stream and drowned.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\\r\\na grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.\\r\\nThen he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he\\r\\ndied too; and so all were dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRAPUNZEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\\r\\nchild. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.\\r\\nThese people had a little window at the back of their house from which\\r\\na splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\\r\\nflowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\\r\\none dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\\r\\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was\\r\\nstanding by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\\r\\nbed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\\r\\nlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\\r\\nand began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and\\r\\nasked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat\\r\\nsome of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\\r\\ndie.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die,\\r\\nbring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’\\r\\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\\r\\nenchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\\r\\nwife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It\\r\\ntasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\\r\\nthree times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband\\r\\nmust once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening\\r\\ntherefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\\r\\nwall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\\r\\nhim. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my\\r\\ngarden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’\\r\\n‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\\r\\nup my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the\\r\\nwindow, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she\\r\\nhad not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be\\r\\nsoftened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow\\r\\nyou to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\\r\\ncondition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into\\r\\nthe world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a\\r\\nmother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the\\r\\nwoman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the\\r\\nchild the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\\r\\ntwelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in\\r\\na forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a\\r\\nlittle window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself\\r\\nbeneath it and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\\r\\nheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\\r\\nwound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair\\r\\nfell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through\\r\\nthe forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\\r\\ncharming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her\\r\\nsolitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king’s\\r\\nson wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,\\r\\nbut none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply\\r\\ntouched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and\\r\\nlistened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw\\r\\nthat an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\\r\\nclimbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\\r\\nwill try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow\\r\\ndark, he went to the tower and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\\r\\nhad never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to\\r\\nher quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred\\r\\nthat it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.\\r\\nThen Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\\r\\nhim for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\\r\\nthought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said\\r\\nyes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I will willingly go away with\\r\\nyou, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk\\r\\nevery time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when\\r\\nthat is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.’ They\\r\\nagreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\\r\\nold woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until\\r\\nonce Rapunzel said to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that\\r\\nyou are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king’s son--he\\r\\nis with me in a moment.’ ‘Ah! you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress.\\r\\n‘What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all\\r\\nthe world, and yet you have deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched\\r\\nRapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,\\r\\nseized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut\\r\\noff, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless\\r\\nthat she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\\r\\ngrief and misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\\r\\nfastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\\r\\nwindow, and when the king’s son came and cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\\r\\n  Let down your hair to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nshe let the hair down. The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding\\r\\nhis dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with\\r\\nwicked and venomous looks. ‘Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ‘you would fetch\\r\\nyour dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;\\r\\nthe cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is\\r\\nlost to you; you will never see her again.’ The king’s son was beside\\r\\nhimself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He\\r\\nescaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his\\r\\neyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but\\r\\nroots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of\\r\\nhis dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\\r\\nlength came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she\\r\\nhad given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a\\r\\nvoice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and\\r\\nwhen he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two\\r\\nof her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could\\r\\nsee with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was\\r\\njoyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and\\r\\ncontented.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFUNDEVOGEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as\\r\\nhe entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\\r\\nthere. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at\\r\\nthe top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen\\r\\nasleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in\\r\\nher arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\\r\\n‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He\\r\\ntook it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the\\r\\none, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\\r\\nhad carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that\\r\\nwhen they did not see each other they were sad.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and\\r\\nbegan to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out\\r\\nto the spring. Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are you\\r\\nfetching so much water?’ ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will\\r\\ntell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,\\r\\nand then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the forester\\r\\nis out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the\\r\\nkettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he\\r\\nwas gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:\\r\\n‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’ Fundevogel\\r\\nsaid: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said Lina: ‘Then\\r\\nwill I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water\\r\\ninto the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said\\r\\nthat if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early\\r\\ntomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle\\r\\nfull of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up\\r\\nquickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went\\r\\naway. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the\\r\\nbedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,\\r\\nand went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly\\r\\nalarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the\\r\\nforester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be\\r\\nfollowed instantly to get them back again.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\\r\\novertake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the\\r\\nforest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\\r\\nsaid to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’\\r\\nFundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become\\r\\na rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to\\r\\nthe forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but\\r\\nthe children were nowhere. Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done\\r\\nhere,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing\\r\\nin the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the\\r\\nold cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the\\r\\nrose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\\r\\nyou; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out and look for\\r\\nthe second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.\\r\\nThen Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave\\r\\nyou.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you\\r\\nbecome a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’ So when the three\\r\\nservants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in\\r\\nit. They said therefore to each other: ‘What can we do here, let us go\\r\\nhome.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;\\r\\nso they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a\\r\\nchandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: ‘You fools! why\\r\\ndid you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home\\r\\nwith you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with\\r\\nthe three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,\\r\\nsaw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling\\r\\nafter them. Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will\\r\\nnever leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’\\r\\nSaid Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook,\\r\\nhowever, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,\\r\\nand was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized\\r\\nher head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old\\r\\nwitch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were\\r\\nheartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\\r\\nwindow; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came\\r\\na peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams,\\r\\ncheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched his\\r\\ndelicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, dear woman;\\r\\nhere you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the three steps\\r\\nto the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots\\r\\nfor him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and\\r\\nat length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four\\r\\nounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no\\r\\nconsequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him\\r\\nwhat he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, this jam\\r\\nshall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health\\r\\nand strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself\\r\\na piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’t\\r\\ntaste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I\\r\\ntake a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made\\r\\nbigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\\r\\nrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were\\r\\nattracted and descended on it in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited you?’ said the\\r\\nlittle tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,\\r\\nwho understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\\r\\nagain in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all\\r\\npatience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\\r\\nand saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on\\r\\nthem. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\\r\\nthan seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that\\r\\nsort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ‘The whole\\r\\ntown shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\\r\\na girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at\\r\\none stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear\\r\\nof it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. The tailor\\r\\nput on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\\r\\nthought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,\\r\\nhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\\r\\ntake with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\\r\\nhe put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which\\r\\nhad caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the\\r\\ncheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\\r\\nhe felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\\r\\nreached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\\r\\npeacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\\r\\nand said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\\r\\nwide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.\\r\\nHave you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously\\r\\nat the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\\r\\nshowed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I\\r\\nam!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had\\r\\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\\r\\nfor the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\\r\\na stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\\r\\nof it. ‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is\\r\\nthat all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his\\r\\nhand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\\r\\nthe liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better,\\r\\nwasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\\r\\nof the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\\r\\nthat the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now, little mite of a man, do\\r\\nthat likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone\\r\\ncame down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\\r\\nback at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\\r\\nand threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,\\r\\nrose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please you,\\r\\ncomrade?’ asked the tailor. ‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant,\\r\\n‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He\\r\\ntook the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on\\r\\nthe ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the\\r\\ntree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you\\r\\nthe trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;\\r\\nafter all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his\\r\\nshoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who\\r\\ncould not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little\\r\\ntailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and\\r\\nwhistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if\\r\\ncarrying the tree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the\\r\\nheavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark\\r\\nyou, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down,\\r\\nseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\\r\\nto the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\\r\\nthe tree!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\\r\\nhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\\r\\ndown, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\\r\\ntailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\\r\\nit sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.\\r\\nWhen he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is\\r\\nthis? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no\\r\\nlack of strength,’ answered the little tailor. ‘Do you think that could\\r\\nbe anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over\\r\\nthe tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.\\r\\nJump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he\\r\\ncould not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so\\r\\nthat in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\\r\\ncavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was willing, and\\r\\nfollowed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\\r\\nthere by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\\r\\nwas eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much\\r\\nmore spacious here than in my workshop.’ The giant showed him a bed, and\\r\\nsaid he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too\\r\\nbig for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into\\r\\na corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little\\r\\ntailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,\\r\\ncut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the\\r\\ngrasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the\\r\\nforest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he\\r\\nwalked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,\\r\\nthey were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a\\r\\ngreat hurry.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.\\r\\nAfter he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\\r\\npalace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.\\r\\nWhilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\\r\\nread on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said they, ‘what does\\r\\nthe great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty\\r\\nlord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their\\r\\nopinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful\\r\\nman who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased\\r\\nthe king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer\\r\\nhim military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by\\r\\nthe sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,\\r\\nand then conveyed to him this proposal. ‘For this very reason have\\r\\nI come here,’ the tailor replied, ‘I am ready to enter the king’s\\r\\nservice.’ He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling\\r\\nwas assigned him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\\r\\nhim a thousand miles away. ‘What is to be the end of this?’ they said\\r\\namong themselves. ‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\\r\\nseven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\\r\\nhim.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to\\r\\nthe king, and begged for their dismissal. ‘We are not prepared,’ said\\r\\nthey, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The king was\\r\\nsorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,\\r\\nwished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly\\r\\nhave been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his\\r\\ndismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people\\r\\ndead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a\\r\\nlong time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor\\r\\nand caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one\\r\\nrequest to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,\\r\\nwho caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,\\r\\nand burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in\\r\\ndanger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he\\r\\nwould give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a\\r\\ndowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.\\r\\n‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the\\r\\nlittle tailor. ‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a\\r\\nkingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon\\r\\nsubdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen\\r\\nto do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of\\r\\ntwo.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.\\r\\nWhen he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:\\r\\n‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’ Then\\r\\nhe bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a\\r\\nwhile he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and\\r\\nsnored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not\\r\\nidle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the\\r\\ntree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat\\r\\njust above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on\\r\\nthe breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,\\r\\nbut at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you\\r\\nknocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking\\r\\nyou.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor\\r\\nthrew a stone down on the second. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried\\r\\nthe other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered\\r\\nthe first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were\\r\\nweary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The\\r\\nlittle tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and\\r\\nthrew it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. ‘That\\r\\nis too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his\\r\\ncompanion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in\\r\\nthe same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and\\r\\nbelaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on\\r\\nthe ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. ‘It is\\r\\na lucky thing,’ said he, ‘that they did not tear up the tree on which\\r\\nI was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a\\r\\nsquirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ He drew out his sword and gave\\r\\neach of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the\\r\\nhorsemen and said: ‘The work is done; I have finished both of them\\r\\noff, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and\\r\\ndefended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\\r\\nlike myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not\\r\\nwounded?’ asked the horsemen. ‘You need not concern yourself about\\r\\nthat,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The\\r\\nhorsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they\\r\\nfound the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the\\r\\ntorn-up trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\\r\\nrepented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get\\r\\nrid of the hero. ‘Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my\\r\\nkingdom,’ said he to him, ‘you must perform one more heroic deed. In\\r\\nthe forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch\\r\\nit first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one\\r\\nblow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went\\r\\nforth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to\\r\\nwait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards\\r\\nhim, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\\r\\nhorn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as\\r\\nthat,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite\\r\\nclose, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against\\r\\nthe tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk\\r\\nthat it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it\\r\\nwas caught. ‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out\\r\\nfrom behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his\\r\\naxe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the\\r\\nbeast away and took it to the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\\r\\ndemand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\\r\\nmade great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\\r\\nhelp. ‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not\\r\\ntake the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\\r\\nthat he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in\\r\\nsuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When\\r\\nthe boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\\r\\nwhetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero\\r\\nfled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at\\r\\nonce, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor\\r\\nran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging\\r\\nbeast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,\\r\\nwas caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\\r\\nmight see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to\\r\\nthe king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his\\r\\npromise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known\\r\\nthat it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before\\r\\nhim, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding\\r\\nwas held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a\\r\\nking was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\\r\\nnight: ‘Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I\\r\\nwill rap the yard-measure over your ears.’ Then she discovered in what\\r\\nstate of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained\\r\\nof her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of\\r\\nher husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her\\r\\nand said: ‘Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants\\r\\nshall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind\\r\\nhim, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide\\r\\nworld.’ The woman was satisfied with this; but the king’s armour-bearer,\\r\\nwho had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of\\r\\nthe whole plot. ‘I’ll put a screw into that business,’ said the little\\r\\ntailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and\\r\\nwhen she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,\\r\\nand then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to\\r\\nbe asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy, make me the doublet\\r\\nand patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your\\r\\nears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one\\r\\nunicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\\r\\noutside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\\r\\nwere overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\\r\\nbehind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\\r\\nhim. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\\r\\nlife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHANSEL AND GRETEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\\r\\ntwo children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had\\r\\nlittle to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\\r\\nland, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought\\r\\nover this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\\r\\ngroaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we\\r\\nto feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\\r\\nourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early\\r\\ntomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where\\r\\nit is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each\\r\\nof them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\\r\\nleave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be\\r\\nrid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I\\r\\nbear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would\\r\\nsoon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we\\r\\nmust all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our\\r\\ncoffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very\\r\\nsorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\\r\\nheard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\\r\\nbitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,\\r\\nGretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\\r\\nto help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\\r\\non his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon\\r\\nshone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\\r\\nglittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the\\r\\nlittle pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went\\r\\nback and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in\\r\\npeace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When\\r\\nday dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the\\r\\ntwo children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the\\r\\nforest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:\\r\\n‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,\\r\\nfor you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,\\r\\nas Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together\\r\\non the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel\\r\\nstood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.\\r\\nHis father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\\r\\nbehind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,\\r\\nfather,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is\\r\\nsitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:\\r\\n‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\\r\\nshining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\\r\\nthe cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\\r\\nout of his pocket on the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,\\r\\nchildren, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\\r\\nbe cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\\r\\nlittle hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\\r\\nvery high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\\r\\nfire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we\\r\\nhave done, we will come back and fetch you away.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\\r\\npiece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\\r\\nbelieved that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but\\r\\na branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\\r\\nblowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long\\r\\ntime, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When\\r\\nat last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and\\r\\nsaid: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted\\r\\nher and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\\r\\nwill soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\\r\\nhis little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\\r\\nnewly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\\r\\nto their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\\r\\nopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty\\r\\nchildren, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\\r\\nnever coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\\r\\nhim to the heart to leave them behind alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\\r\\nland, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\\r\\nfather: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that\\r\\nis the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the\\r\\nwood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other\\r\\nmeans of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:\\r\\n‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your\\r\\nchildren.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to\\r\\nsay, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,\\r\\nand as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\\r\\nalso.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\\r\\nWhen the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go\\r\\nout and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked\\r\\nthe door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his\\r\\nlittle sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the\\r\\ngood God will help us.’\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\\r\\nbeds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\\r\\nthan the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his\\r\\nin his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\\r\\n‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I\\r\\nam looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and\\r\\nwants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,\\r\\n‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining\\r\\non the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs\\r\\non the path.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\\r\\nnever in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\\r\\nthe mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\\r\\nyou may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\\r\\nthe evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When\\r\\nit was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\\r\\nscattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but\\r\\nno one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark\\r\\nnight, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,\\r\\nGretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\\r\\nwhich I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When\\r\\nthe moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\\r\\nthousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\\r\\nthem all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but\\r\\nthey did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day\\r\\ntoo from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\\r\\nand were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\\r\\nberries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their\\r\\nlegs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\\r\\nasleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They\\r\\nbegan to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\\r\\nhelp did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it\\r\\nwas mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\\r\\nwhich sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And\\r\\nwhen its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\\r\\nand they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\\r\\nwhich it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\\r\\nthat it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\\r\\nwere of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and\\r\\nhave a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\\r\\nsome of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and\\r\\nbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\\r\\nagainst the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried\\r\\nfrom the parlour:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\\r\\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘The wind, the wind,\\r\\n  The heaven-born wind,’\\r\\n\\r\\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\\r\\ntaste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\\r\\nthe whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\\r\\nit. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\\r\\nsupported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were\\r\\nso terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\\r\\nhands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear\\r\\nchildren, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No\\r\\nharm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them\\r\\ninto her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and\\r\\npancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little\\r\\nbeds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\\r\\nin them, and thought they were in heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality\\r\\na wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\\r\\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell\\r\\ninto her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\\r\\nday with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\\r\\na keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.\\r\\nWhen Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with\\r\\nmalice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me\\r\\nagain!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was\\r\\nalready up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\\r\\npretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That\\r\\nwill be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled\\r\\nhand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a\\r\\ngrated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to\\r\\nGretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch\\r\\nsome water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the\\r\\nstable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’\\r\\nGretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was\\r\\nforced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing\\r\\nbut crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and\\r\\ncried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon\\r\\nbe fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and\\r\\nthe old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was\\r\\nHansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening\\r\\nhim. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she\\r\\nwas seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,\\r\\nGretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.\\r\\nLet Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,\\r\\nhow the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,\\r\\nand how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she\\r\\ncried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should\\r\\nat any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’\\r\\nsaid the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\\r\\nthe water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,\\r\\n‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor\\r\\nGretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.\\r\\n‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that\\r\\nwe can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to\\r\\nshut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.\\r\\nBut Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am\\r\\nto do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door\\r\\nis big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and\\r\\nthrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove\\r\\nher far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then\\r\\nshe began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless\\r\\nwitch was miserably burnt to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,\\r\\nand cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel\\r\\nsprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did\\r\\nrejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And\\r\\nas they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s\\r\\nhouse, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.\\r\\n‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his\\r\\npockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take\\r\\nsomething home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must\\r\\nbe off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\\r\\nwater. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no\\r\\nbridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white\\r\\nduck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she\\r\\ncried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\\r\\n  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\\r\\n  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\\r\\n  Take us across on thy back so white.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\\r\\nhis sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy\\r\\nfor the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The\\r\\ngood little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had\\r\\nwalked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar\\r\\nto them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then\\r\\nthey began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round\\r\\ntheir father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had\\r\\nleft the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel\\r\\nemptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the\\r\\nroom, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to\\r\\nadd to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together\\r\\nin perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever\\r\\ncatches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\\r\\npartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\\r\\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\\r\\nconsiderably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the\\r\\nwood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\\r\\nto the cooking.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen people are too well off they always begin to long for something\\r\\nnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\\r\\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\\r\\nhousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\\r\\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\\r\\nat home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire\\r\\nand fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\\r\\nuntil it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the\\r\\npot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\\r\\ndinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\\r\\namong the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\\r\\nand salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and\\r\\nhad laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\\r\\nfinished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\\r\\nmorning: and that was really a very delightful life.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfluenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\\r\\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\\r\\nand had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\\r\\nchange, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray\\r\\nas the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\\r\\nmaster of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore\\r\\ndrew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\\r\\nto cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\\r\\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\\r\\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\\r\\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\\r\\nflew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across\\r\\na dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate\\r\\nbooty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog\\r\\nof this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for\\r\\nthe dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and\\r\\nthat was the reason his life had been forfeited.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\\r\\nhad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the\\r\\nbest of things and to remain with one another.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,\\r\\nwishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and\\r\\nout among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the\\r\\npot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having\\r\\nalready parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\\r\\ncould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\\r\\nhere and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to\\r\\nbe found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,\\r\\ncaught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,\\r\\nbut his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable\\r\\nto recover himself, he was drowned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMOTHER HOLLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\\r\\nwas beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\\r\\nhowever, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\\r\\ndaughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made\\r\\nto do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\\r\\nfamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\\r\\nthe high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\\r\\nchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl\\r\\nstopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out\\r\\nof her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her\\r\\nmisfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving\\r\\nher a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall\\r\\ninto the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\\r\\nher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\\r\\nbeautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming\\r\\nin every direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven\\r\\nfull of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us\\r\\nout, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long\\r\\nago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.\\r\\n‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,\\r\\nare ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon\\r\\nher like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single\\r\\napple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a\\r\\nheap and walked on again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\\r\\nwoman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\\r\\nturned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you\\r\\nafraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\\r\\nproperly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,\\r\\nhowever, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\\r\\nit thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\\r\\nin the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman\\r\\nspoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter\\r\\ninto her service.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and\\r\\nevery time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the\\r\\nfeathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good\\r\\nas her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and\\r\\nboiled meats every day.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\\r\\nto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\\r\\nbecame conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she\\r\\nwas homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother\\r\\nHolle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went\\r\\nto Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with\\r\\nyou any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own\\r\\npeople.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back\\r\\nto your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I\\r\\nwill take you home myself.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate\\r\\nwas opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\\r\\nher, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\\r\\nhead to foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she\\r\\nspoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\\r\\nworld close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\\r\\ncock who was perched on the well, called out:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!\\r\\n  Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\\r\\ncovered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\\r\\nall that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her\\r\\ngreat riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go\\r\\nand try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well\\r\\nand spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a\\r\\nthorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then\\r\\nshe threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\\r\\ntill she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall\\r\\nbe burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves\\r\\nas before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty\\r\\nmy hands for you?’ and walked on.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\\r\\napples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice\\r\\nthing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and\\r\\npassed on.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about\\r\\nthe large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\\r\\nherself without delay to the old woman.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\\r\\nto please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\\r\\nreturn. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and\\r\\nthe third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in\\r\\nthe mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to\\r\\nmake the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the\\r\\nfeathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,\\r\\nand told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and\\r\\nthought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her,\\r\\nas she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing\\r\\nthrough, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came\\r\\npouring over her.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut\\r\\nthe gate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the\\r\\nwell called out as she saw her:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!\\r\\n  Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\\r\\nher as long as she lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\\r\\nwho looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\\r\\nnothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a\\r\\nlittle cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\\r\\nwear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\\r\\nof cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\\r\\nand weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and\\r\\nwhen you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\\r\\nor you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\\r\\nget nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good\\r\\nmorning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\\r\\nher hand on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\\r\\nand just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap\\r\\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘To my grandmother’s.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What have you got in your apron?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\\r\\nhave something good, to make her stronger.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\\r\\nunder the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\\r\\nsurely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice\\r\\nplump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\\r\\nact craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by\\r\\nthe side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how\\r\\npretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,\\r\\ntoo, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\\r\\nwalk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\\r\\nout here in the wood is merry.’\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\\r\\nhere and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\\r\\nshe thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\\r\\nplease her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\\r\\nin good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\\r\\nflowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\\r\\nstill prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\\r\\ndeeper into the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked\\r\\nat the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Who is there?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open\\r\\nthe door.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot\\r\\nget up.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\\r\\nword he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then\\r\\nhe put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\\r\\nand drew the curtains.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\\r\\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\\r\\nremembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\\r\\nwent into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\\r\\nherself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\\r\\nbeing with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but\\r\\nreceived no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\\r\\nThere lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\\r\\nlooking very strange.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The better to see you with, my dear.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The better to hug you with.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The better to eat you with!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\\r\\nbed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\\r\\nfell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\\r\\nthe house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must\\r\\njust see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he\\r\\ncame to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you\\r\\nhere, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as\\r\\nhe was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\\r\\ndevoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did\\r\\nnot fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach\\r\\nof the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little\\r\\nRed-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl\\r\\nsprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was\\r\\ninside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive\\r\\nalso, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched\\r\\ngreat stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,\\r\\nhe wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at\\r\\nonce, and fell dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and\\r\\nwent home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\\r\\nRed-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As\\r\\nlong as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the\\r\\nwood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\\r\\ngrandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\\r\\npath. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on\\r\\nher way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he\\r\\nhad said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,\\r\\nthat if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would\\r\\nhave eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door,\\r\\nthat he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:\\r\\n‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you\\r\\nsome cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard\\r\\nstole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,\\r\\nintending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to\\r\\nsteal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother\\r\\nsaw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone\\r\\ntrough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some\\r\\nsausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the\\r\\ntrough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the\\r\\nsmell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,\\r\\nand at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep\\r\\nhis footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight\\r\\ninto the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,\\r\\nand no one ever did anything to harm her again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\\r\\ngrown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided\\r\\nfor. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who\\r\\ncomes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as\\r\\nhe appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\\r\\nwhich to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did\\r\\nnot care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.\\r\\nShe did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\\r\\nnor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You\\r\\nhave not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\\r\\ntime.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is\\r\\nout there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by\\r\\nsaying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed\\r\\nonly replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already\\r\\ninvited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I\\r\\nwill strew ashes along the path.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\\r\\ndread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might\\r\\nbe able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\\r\\nlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the\\r\\nentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these\\r\\nshe followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every\\r\\nstep she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,\\r\\ndarkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so\\r\\ngrim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped\\r\\ninside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned\\r\\nthroughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\\r\\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\\r\\ncage on the wall. Again it cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\\r\\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\\r\\nall empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,\\r\\nand there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\\r\\nshaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband\\r\\nlives here?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to\\r\\ncome to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride,\\r\\nand that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that\\r\\nyou will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron\\r\\nof water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have\\r\\nyou in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat\\r\\nyou, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save\\r\\nyou, you would be lost.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\\r\\nfrom view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,\\r\\nor it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are\\r\\nall asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an\\r\\nopportunity to escape.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\\r\\ndragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and\\r\\npaid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,\\r\\nthree glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,\\r\\nand with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her\\r\\ndainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into\\r\\npieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the\\r\\ncask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by\\r\\nthe robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on\\r\\nthe little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off\\r\\neasily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang\\r\\ninto the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was\\r\\nhiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he\\r\\ncould not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of\\r\\nthe others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers,\\r\\nand let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\\r\\nthe finger and sat down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\\r\\nlong they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\\r\\nsnoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind\\r\\nthe cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who\\r\\nwere lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed\\r\\ndread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she\\r\\npassed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,\\r\\nopened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’\\r\\nden. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and\\r\\nlentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide\\r\\nthem in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it\\r\\nwas morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father\\r\\nall that had happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom\\r\\narrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken\\r\\ncare to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,\\r\\neach guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did\\r\\nnot say a word.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no\\r\\ntale you know? Tell us something.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a\\r\\nforest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but\\r\\na bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\\r\\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\\r\\n\\r\\nand again a second time it said these words.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,\\r\\nand everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the\\r\\ncellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her\\r\\nhead still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,\\r\\n“Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed\\r\\ndoes indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards\\r\\ncook and eat you.”’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done\\r\\nthis when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with\\r\\nthem. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and\\r\\nyellow, and with that she died.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into\\r\\npieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her\\r\\nfinger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut\\r\\noff her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the\\r\\ngreat cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And\\r\\nwith these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the\\r\\nassembled guests.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\\r\\ntried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They\\r\\ndelivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\\r\\ncondemned to death for their wicked deeds.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTOM THUMB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\\r\\nfireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is,\\r\\nwife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me\\r\\nto sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\\r\\nus while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’\\r\\n‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round\\r\\nher wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were\\r\\never so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very\\r\\nhappy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to\\r\\npass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she\\r\\nhad wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was\\r\\nquite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So\\r\\nthey said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,\\r\\nlittle as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas\\r\\nThumb.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\\r\\nbigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\\r\\nStill, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to\\r\\nbe a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\\r\\nfuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\\r\\nwant to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that;\\r\\nthe cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman\\r\\nlaughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s\\r\\nbridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only\\r\\nharness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to\\r\\ngo.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\\r\\nTom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\\r\\nto go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse\\r\\nwent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\\r\\nwood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\\r\\nwas calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd\\r\\nthing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a\\r\\ncarter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,\\r\\nindeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it\\r\\ngoes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\\r\\nplace where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\\r\\nout, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take\\r\\nme down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\\r\\nthe other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a\\r\\nstraw, where he sat as merry as you please.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\\r\\nto say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That\\r\\nlittle urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\\r\\nabout from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to\\r\\nthe woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He\\r\\nwill be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell\\r\\nhim at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\\r\\nthan all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the\\r\\nbargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder\\r\\nand whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;\\r\\nI’ll soon come back to you.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\\r\\nlarge piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to\\r\\nsit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be\\r\\na nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we\\r\\ngo along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his\\r\\nfather they took him away with them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\\r\\nsaid, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and\\r\\nput him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the\\r\\nroad. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into\\r\\nan old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and\\r\\nlook sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place,\\r\\nand poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;\\r\\nTom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite\\r\\ndark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as\\r\\nsulky as could be.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What\\r\\ndangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I were to\\r\\nfall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’\\r\\nAt last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. ‘This is\\r\\nlucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\\r\\ntogether; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s\\r\\nhouse of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom. ‘What noise\\r\\nwas that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’\\r\\nThey stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll\\r\\nsoon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said\\r\\nthey. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the\\r\\nsound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him\\r\\nup in their hands. ‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for\\r\\nus?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house,\\r\\nand throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the\\r\\nthieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the\\r\\nwindow-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,\\r\\n‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened,\\r\\nand said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’\\r\\nBut Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,\\r\\n‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in\\r\\nthe next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and\\r\\nlistened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little\\r\\nway; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little\\r\\nurchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and\\r\\nwhispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your\\r\\nroguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out\\r\\nas loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to\\r\\nopen the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and\\r\\nthe maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.\\r\\nBy the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when\\r\\nshe had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found\\r\\nnobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her\\r\\neyes open.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\\r\\nplace to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning\\r\\nto sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and\\r\\nmother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows\\r\\nhappen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,\\r\\nto feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away\\r\\na large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast\\r\\nasleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found\\r\\nhimself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the\\r\\ncow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. ‘Good\\r\\nlack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon\\r\\nfound out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about\\r\\nhim, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to\\r\\ndeath. At last down he went into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said\\r\\nhe; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a\\r\\ncandle would be no bad thing.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThough he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at\\r\\nall; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming\\r\\ndown, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he\\r\\ncried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay! Don’t bring\\r\\nme any more hay!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\\r\\nspeak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice\\r\\nthat she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off\\r\\nher stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself\\r\\nup out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the\\r\\nparson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson\\r\\nsaid, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the\\r\\ncow-house, to try and see what was the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nScarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t\\r\\nbring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and\\r\\nthinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the\\r\\nspot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom\\r\\nlay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy\\r\\ntask; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh\\r\\nill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the\\r\\nwhole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would\\r\\nnot dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called\\r\\nout, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s that?’\\r\\nsaid the wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his own\\r\\nfather’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and\\r\\nthen into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold\\r\\nchicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can\\r\\nwish.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to\\r\\nthe house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into\\r\\nthe pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content. As soon as\\r\\nhe had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that\\r\\nhe could not go out by the same way he came in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\\r\\ngreat shout, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be easy?’ said the\\r\\nwolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’\\r\\n‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now\\r\\nI’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as\\r\\nloud as he could.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through\\r\\na crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\\r\\nsuppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his\\r\\naxe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman,\\r\\n‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the\\r\\nscythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father! I am here,\\r\\nthe wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised! we\\r\\nhave found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the\\r\\nscythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and\\r\\nstruck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was\\r\\ndead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ‘Ah!’ said the father,\\r\\n‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have\\r\\ntravelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we\\r\\nparted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’\\r\\n‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ‘I have been in a\\r\\nmouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in the\\r\\nwolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back, and we will not sell you again\\r\\nfor all the riches in the world.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty\\r\\nto eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new\\r\\nclothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.\\r\\nSo Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for\\r\\nthough he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many\\r\\nfine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always\\r\\nagreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRUMPELSTILTSKIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\\r\\nof water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was\\r\\nclose by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.\\r\\nShe was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud\\r\\nof her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and\\r\\nhunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now\\r\\nthis king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast\\r\\nhis greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before\\r\\nhim. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great\\r\\nheap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must\\r\\nbe spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain\\r\\nthat the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,\\r\\nfor that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber\\r\\ndoor was locked, and she was left alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\\r\\nfate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\\r\\nhobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\\r\\nweeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and\\r\\nI know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it\\r\\nfor you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,\\r\\nand sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Round about, round about,\\r\\n    Lo and behold!\\r\\n  Reel away, reel away,\\r\\n    Straw into gold!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\\r\\nthe straw was all spun into gold.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\\r\\nbut his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\\r\\nmiller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,\\r\\nand sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’\\r\\nsaid she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the\\r\\nwheel again, and whistled and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Round about, round about,\\r\\n    Lo and behold!\\r\\n  Reel away, reel away,\\r\\n    Straw into gold!’\\r\\n\\r\\ntill, long before morning, all was done again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;\\r\\nbut still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet\\r\\nlarger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,\\r\\nyou shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’\\r\\n‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said\\r\\nthe little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are\\r\\nqueen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she\\r\\nknew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he\\r\\nasked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once\\r\\nmore spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding\\r\\nall he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s\\r\\ndaughter, and she really became queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the\\r\\ndwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where\\r\\nshe was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then\\r\\nshe grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all\\r\\nthe wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at\\r\\nlast her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’\\r\\ngrace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your\\r\\nchild.’\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that\\r\\nshe had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find\\r\\nout new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with\\r\\nTIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could\\r\\nremember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my\\r\\nname.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\\r\\nBANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman\\r\\nstill said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have\\r\\ntravelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as\\r\\nI was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox\\r\\nand the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before\\r\\nthe hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was\\r\\ndancing upon one leg, and singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n “Merrily the feast I’ll make.\\r\\n  Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;\\r\\n  Merrily I’ll dance and sing,\\r\\n  For next day will a stranger bring.\\r\\n  Little does my lady dream\\r\\n  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little\\r\\nfriend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round\\r\\nto enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her\\r\\narms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began\\r\\nto chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with\\r\\nhim to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my\\r\\nname?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’\\r\\n‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?’ said the\\r\\nlady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried\\r\\nthe little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the\\r\\nfloor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the\\r\\nbaby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much\\r\\ntrouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a\\r\\nmerry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEVER GRETEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\\r\\nwhen she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,\\r\\nwas quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when\\r\\nshe came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,\\r\\nand as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she\\r\\nwas cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what\\r\\nthe food is like.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a\\r\\nguest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will\\r\\nsee to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,\\r\\nplucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\\r\\nthe fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were\\r\\nnearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out\\r\\nto her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\\r\\nfrom the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\\r\\nthe moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run\\r\\nmyself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,\\r\\nGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing\\r\\nso long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\\r\\nwhen they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\\r\\ndrink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’\\r\\nand took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\\r\\nnot be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\\r\\nand drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,\\r\\nGretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’\\r\\nShe touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It\\r\\ncertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\\r\\ntime!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\\r\\nhis guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\\r\\n‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’\\r\\nSo she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\\r\\nthought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\\r\\nsomething is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and\\r\\nlooked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to\\r\\nher: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\\r\\nsomewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\\r\\nbeen cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\\r\\neaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’\\r\\nSo she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\\r\\none chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\\r\\nand still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\\r\\n‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s\\r\\nright for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\\r\\nanother draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty\\r\\ndrink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry\\r\\nup, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will\\r\\nsoon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that\\r\\nthe table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\\r\\ngoing to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently\\r\\nthe guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.\\r\\nGretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\\r\\nshe put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly\\r\\nas you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\\r\\ncertainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\\r\\ntwo ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest\\r\\nheard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\\r\\ncould. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\\r\\n‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by\\r\\nthat?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just\\r\\ngoing to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a\\r\\nnice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had\\r\\nbut left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to\\r\\nhim to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him\\r\\nwith the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning\\r\\nthat the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The\\r\\nguest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of\\r\\nhis ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take\\r\\nthem both with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull\\r\\nof hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly\\r\\nhold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run\\r\\nout of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so\\r\\nthe old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,\\r\\nand they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough\\r\\nof it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of\\r\\ntears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it\\r\\nfell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said\\r\\nnothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few\\r\\nhalf-pence, out of which he had to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\\r\\nbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are\\r\\nyou doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’\\r\\nanswered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\\r\\nbegan to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\\r\\nhenceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he\\r\\ndid spill a little of anything.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE LITTLE PEASANT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\\r\\npeasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He\\r\\nhad not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\\r\\nyet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:\\r\\n‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall\\r\\nmake us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any\\r\\nother, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman\\r\\nalso liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed\\r\\nthe calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head\\r\\nhanging down as if it were eating.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\\r\\ncalled the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there,\\r\\nbut it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All\\r\\nright,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\\r\\nit among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\\r\\nwhich was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself,\\r\\njust look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the\\r\\nherd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat\\r\\nyour fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you\\r\\nhome again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and\\r\\nwaited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\\r\\nthe village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The\\r\\ncow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. It would not\\r\\nstop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must\\r\\nhave my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together,\\r\\nbut someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: ‘It\\r\\nmust have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me\\r\\nthat,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness\\r\\ncondemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\\r\\nso long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for\\r\\nit, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They\\r\\nsalted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell\\r\\nthe skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On\\r\\nthe way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,\\r\\nand out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the\\r\\nweather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could\\r\\ngo no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The\\r\\nmiller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay\\r\\nyourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.\\r\\nThe peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman\\r\\nthought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the\\r\\nparson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is\\r\\nout, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard\\r\\nthem talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make\\r\\nshift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four\\r\\ndifferent things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\\r\\noutside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly\\r\\nhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,\\r\\nthe salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet\\r\\non the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank\\r\\nheaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the\\r\\nworld were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the\\r\\nstraw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the\\r\\nwife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for\\r\\nshelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where\\r\\nthe straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get\\r\\nme something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and\\r\\ncheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as\\r\\nI am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and\\r\\nsaid: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to\\r\\nbe invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin\\r\\nin which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you\\r\\nthere?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can\\r\\nhe foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered\\r\\nthe peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to\\r\\nhimself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something\\r\\nfor once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked\\r\\nand made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The\\r\\npeasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine\\r\\nhidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there\\r\\nand found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven\\r\\ncroak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some\\r\\nroast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and\\r\\nwent thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven\\r\\nprophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some\\r\\nsalad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and\\r\\nwent there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven\\r\\nonce more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there\\r\\nare some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the\\r\\nmiller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife\\r\\nwas frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with\\r\\nher. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little\\r\\npeasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth\\r\\nis something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much\\r\\nthe miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on\\r\\nthree hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s\\r\\nhead till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The\\r\\npeasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in\\r\\nthe closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and\\r\\nopened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,\\r\\nand the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he\\r\\ncould, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my\\r\\nown eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with\\r\\nthe three hundred talers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\\r\\nhouse, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to\\r\\nthe place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in\\r\\nshovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and\\r\\nbidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s\\r\\nskin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard\\r\\nthat, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed\\r\\nall their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in\\r\\nthe town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: ‘But my\\r\\nservant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he\\r\\ndid not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others\\r\\ncame, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all\\r\\nthese skins?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\\r\\noutwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\\r\\ntreachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously\\r\\nsentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\\r\\npierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who\\r\\nwas to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to\\r\\na distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the\\r\\nman who had been with the miller’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free\\r\\nfrom the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up\\r\\ncame, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had\\r\\nlong been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I\\r\\nwill not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The\\r\\nshepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about?\\r\\nWhat is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make\\r\\nme mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’\\r\\nThe shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be\\r\\nmayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you\\r\\nwill get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in,\\r\\nand the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s\\r\\nflock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,\\r\\nand declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the\\r\\nbarrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd\\r\\ncried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than\\r\\nthat it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is\\r\\nwhat we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below\\r\\nthere,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the\\r\\nvillage, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of\\r\\nsheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,\\r\\nand said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the\\r\\nwater?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down,\\r\\nuntil at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\\r\\nbarrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\\r\\nof lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\\r\\nme.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he,\\r\\n‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that\\r\\nthey too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the\\r\\nmayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just\\r\\nthen there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\\r\\nare called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon\\r\\nthe peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor\\r\\npressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and\\r\\nif things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash! went\\r\\nthe water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd\\r\\nplunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and\\r\\nthe small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFREDERICK AND CATHERINE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\\r\\nCatherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\\r\\n‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\\r\\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’\\r\\n‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew\\r\\nnigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\\r\\nput it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to\\r\\ncrackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\\r\\nthen she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\\r\\nto the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a\\r\\nlarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran\\r\\ninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her\\r\\nhead, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\\r\\nthat’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\\r\\nthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAway ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\\r\\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what\\r\\ncan’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round;\\r\\nand as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\\r\\nto cool herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\\r\\nthe cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\\r\\nthe cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\\r\\nhappened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from\\r\\nseeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last\\r\\nremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\\r\\nand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\\r\\nnicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have\\r\\nnow a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set\\r\\nit down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\\r\\nall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah!\\r\\nwell,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she\\r\\nstrewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her\\r\\ncleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAt noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for\\r\\ndinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but\\r\\nwhile I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\\r\\nI ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\\r\\nwith the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the\\r\\ncellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he,\\r\\n‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the\\r\\nale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I\\r\\ndid not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must\\r\\nlook sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\\r\\nsaid to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put\\r\\nthem into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you\\r\\nnever go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that\\r\\nI never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with\\r\\nearthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.\\r\\n‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if\\r\\nyou had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow\\r\\nbuttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden\\r\\nand dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare\\r\\nnot go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these\\r\\nyellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of\\r\\nplates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:\\r\\nand when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been\\r\\ndoing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow\\r\\nbuttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves\\r\\nand dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of\\r\\nwork you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you\\r\\nto do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any\\r\\nharm in it; you should have told me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\\r\\n‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\\r\\nthe thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter\\r\\nand cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’\\r\\n‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\\r\\nfastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought\\r\\nshe: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\\r\\nwas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees\\r\\non each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have\\r\\nbruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she\\r\\ntook pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so\\r\\nthat the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this\\r\\nkind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down\\r\\nthe hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she\\r\\nsaid, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he\\r\\nhas younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after\\r\\nit; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said\\r\\nshe supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she\\r\\ncould not stay there all day waiting for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\\r\\neat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’\\r\\nsaid he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor\\r\\ntrees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I\\r\\nsent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on\\r\\nthe road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly\\r\\nthings!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure\\r\\nyou never told me not.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThey ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you\\r\\nlocked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did\\r\\nnot tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’\\r\\nsaid Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\\r\\n‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of\\r\\nbutter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,\\r\\nfor I have often seen him take some.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\\r\\ntook off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but\\r\\nsurely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took\\r\\nher time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried\\r\\nout, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as\\r\\ncarefully as you please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I\\r\\nhave! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so\\r\\nthat everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have\\r\\nbrought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’\\r\\n‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the\\r\\nnuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if\\r\\nyou please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’\\r\\n\\r\\nFrederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\\r\\ninto the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and\\r\\nwhen it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.\\r\\nScarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\\r\\nwere looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\\r\\nclass of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;\\r\\nso they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\\r\\nCatherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\\r\\nsome stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on\\r\\nthe head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for\\r\\nthe wind shakes the fir-apples down.’\\r\\n\\r\\nCatherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\\r\\nbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\\r\\nsoftly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not\\r\\nnow, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well,\\r\\nthen, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled\\r\\nthe nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me,\\r\\nit is hailing.’\\r\\n\\r\\nA little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\\r\\nso she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray\\r\\ndon’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said\\r\\nshe, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\\r\\nsaid, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that\\r\\nwas so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw\\r\\nthe door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he\\r\\nwas sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down\\r\\nwent the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried\\r\\nout ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they\\r\\ncould, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,\\r\\nthere they found all their money safe and sound.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSWEETHEART ROLAND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\\r\\ndaughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\\r\\nher own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\\r\\nbecause she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty\\r\\napron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\\r\\ntold her mother that she must and would have that apron. ‘Be quiet, my\\r\\nchild,’ said the old woman, ‘and you shall have it. Your stepsister has\\r\\nlong deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her\\r\\nhead off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and\\r\\npush her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor\\r\\ngirl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard\\r\\neverything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime\\r\\nhad come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the\\r\\nfar side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the\\r\\nfront, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In\\r\\nthe night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right\\r\\nhand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,\\r\\nand then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s\\r\\nhead off.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who\\r\\nwas called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said\\r\\nto him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother\\r\\nwanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,\\r\\nand she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said Roland,\\r\\n‘I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape\\r\\nif she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the\\r\\ndead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in\\r\\nfront of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she\\r\\nhurried away with her lover.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\\r\\nwanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch\\r\\ncried: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered\\r\\nthe first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\\r\\nstairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, I am\\r\\nwarming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the\\r\\nkitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah,\\r\\nhere in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She went\\r\\ninto the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,\\r\\nwhose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into\\r\\na passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\\r\\ninto the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\\r\\nsweetheart Roland. ‘That shall not help you,’ cried she, ‘even if you\\r\\nhave got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on her\\r\\nmany-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every step,\\r\\nand it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when\\r\\nshe saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic\\r\\nwand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\\r\\nswimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,\\r\\nthrew breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\\r\\nbut the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\\r\\ngo home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart\\r\\nRoland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole\\r\\nnight until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful\\r\\nflower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart\\r\\nRoland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up\\r\\ntowards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear musician, may I pluck that\\r\\nbeautiful flower for myself?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will play to\\r\\nyou while you do it.’ As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was\\r\\njust going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower\\r\\nwas, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced\\r\\nto dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more\\r\\nviolent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes\\r\\nfrom her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he\\r\\ndid not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my father and\\r\\narrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and\\r\\nwait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will\\r\\nchange myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away, and the\\r\\ngirl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.\\r\\nBut when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\\r\\nfascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a\\r\\nlong time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\\r\\nchanged herself into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come\\r\\nthis way, and trample me down.’\\r\\n\\r\\nIt befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\\r\\nthe flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\\r\\nlaid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened\\r\\nin the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was\\r\\nalready done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the\\r\\nfire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,\\r\\nwhen he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He\\r\\ncould not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being\\r\\nin his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was\\r\\ncertainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so\\r\\nafraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise\\r\\nwoman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some\\r\\nmorning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no\\r\\nmatter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will\\r\\nbe stopped.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\\r\\nhe saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he\\r\\nsprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the\\r\\ntransformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\\r\\nwho admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\\r\\ntime she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,\\r\\nand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\\r\\nanswered: ‘No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\\r\\nRoland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to\\r\\ngo away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,\\r\\nand then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\\r\\nthat all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\\r\\nbridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\\r\\nthat she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\\r\\nbut the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,\\r\\nshe stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she\\r\\ncould not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s\\r\\nears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice, that is the true\\r\\nbride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and which had\\r\\nvanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then\\r\\nthe faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and\\r\\ngrief came to an end and joy began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOWDROP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling\\r\\naround, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working\\r\\nat her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and\\r\\nas she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three\\r\\ndrops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red\\r\\ndrops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little\\r\\ndaughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as\\r\\nblack as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow\\r\\nup; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and\\r\\nher hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became\\r\\nqueen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear\\r\\nto think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy\\r\\nlooking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon\\r\\nherself in it, and say:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!\\r\\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\\r\\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the glass had always answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years\\r\\nold she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.\\r\\nThen the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it\\r\\nas usual:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\\r\\n  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to\\r\\none of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,\\r\\nthat I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but\\r\\nhis heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he\\r\\nsaid, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by\\r\\nherself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would\\r\\ntear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his\\r\\nheart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to\\r\\nher fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and\\r\\nthe wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the\\r\\nevening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for\\r\\nher little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and\\r\\nneat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there\\r\\nwere seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses\\r\\nwith wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by\\r\\nthe wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked\\r\\na little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each\\r\\nglass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she\\r\\ntried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too\\r\\nshort, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself\\r\\ndown and went to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little\\r\\ndwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.\\r\\nThey lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not\\r\\nright. The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The second,\\r\\n‘Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking my\\r\\nbread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with my spoon?’ The fifth,\\r\\n‘Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with\\r\\nmy knife?’ The seventh, ‘Who has been drinking my wine?’ Then the first\\r\\nlooked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on my bed?’ And the rest came\\r\\nrunning to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his\\r\\nbed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come\\r\\nand see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought\\r\\ntheir lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a lovely child\\r\\nshe is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake\\r\\nher; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs\\r\\nin turn, till the night was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,\\r\\nand said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and\\r\\nknit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would\\r\\ntake good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,\\r\\nseeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at\\r\\nhome; and they warned her, and said, ‘The queen will soon find out where\\r\\nyou are, so take care and let no one in.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she\\r\\nmust be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!\\r\\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\\r\\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the glass answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\\r\\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\\r\\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\\r\\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\\r\\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\\r\\nalways spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.\\r\\nAnd she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful\\r\\nthan she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went\\r\\nher way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she\\r\\nknocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ Snowdrop looked\\r\\nout at the window, and said, ‘Good day, good woman! what have you to\\r\\nsell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ‘laces and bobbins of all\\r\\ncolours.’ ‘I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good\\r\\nsort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.\\r\\n‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how badly your stays are laced! Let me\\r\\nlace them up with one of my nice new laces.’ Snowdrop did not dream of\\r\\nany mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work\\r\\nso nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop’s breath was\\r\\nstopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. ‘There’s an end to all\\r\\nthy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how\\r\\ngrieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the\\r\\nground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when\\r\\nthey found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she\\r\\nbegan to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, ‘The\\r\\nold woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one\\r\\nin when we are away.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it\\r\\nas before; but to her great grief it still said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\\r\\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\\r\\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\\r\\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\\r\\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that\\r\\nSnowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite\\r\\nanother dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned\\r\\ncomb. When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at the door, and\\r\\ncried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ‘I dare not let anyone\\r\\nin.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my beautiful combs!’ and gave\\r\\nher the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and\\r\\nput it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,\\r\\nthe poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. ‘There you may\\r\\nlie,’ said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs\\r\\ncame in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on\\r\\nthe ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned\\r\\ncomb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that\\r\\nhad passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to\\r\\nanyone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she\\r\\nread the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die,\\r\\nif it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got\\r\\nready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but\\r\\nwhoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a\\r\\npeasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage,\\r\\nand knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and\\r\\nsaid, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do\\r\\nas you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty\\r\\napple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’\\r\\n‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of? Do you\\r\\nthink it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the\\r\\nother.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the\\r\\nother side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for\\r\\nthe apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she\\r\\ncould wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,\\r\\nwhen she fell down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save\\r\\nthee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could\\r\\nbe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop\\r\\nlying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid\\r\\nthat she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and\\r\\nwashed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little\\r\\ngirl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven\\r\\nwatched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they\\r\\nwould bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just\\r\\nas it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in\\r\\nthe cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might\\r\\nstill look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name\\r\\nwas, and that she was a king’s daughter. And the coffin was set among\\r\\nthe hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the\\r\\nbirds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came\\r\\nan owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\\r\\nthough she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red\\r\\nas blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the\\r\\ndwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden\\r\\nletters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them\\r\\nto let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for\\r\\nall the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and\\r\\ngave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home\\r\\nwith him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop\\r\\nawoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe\\r\\nwith me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better\\r\\nthan all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall\\r\\nbe my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;\\r\\nand everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their\\r\\nwedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen;\\r\\nand as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the\\r\\nglass and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!\\r\\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\\r\\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the glass answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\\r\\n  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity\\r\\nwere so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And\\r\\nwhen she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as\\r\\nshe thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell\\r\\ndown and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily\\r\\nover that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the\\r\\nmountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind\\r\\nto Snowdrop in her time of need.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE PINK\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\\r\\nEvery morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\\r\\nbestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her\\r\\nand said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,\\r\\nso that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.’ Then\\r\\nshe went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time\\r\\nwas come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\\r\\nbeasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It\\r\\nhappened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\\r\\nher arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the\\r\\nchild had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,\\r\\nand cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen’s apron\\r\\nand on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,\\r\\nwhere a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and\\r\\naccused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by\\r\\nthe wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed\\r\\nthis, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,\\r\\nin which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into\\r\\nit, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat\\r\\nor drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the\\r\\nshape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her\\r\\nfood until the seven years were over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cook, however, thought to himself: ‘If the child has the power of\\r\\nwishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So\\r\\nhe left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\\r\\nspeak, and said to him: ‘Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\\r\\na garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words out\\r\\nof the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.\\r\\nAfter a while the cook said to him: ‘It is not well for you to be so\\r\\nalone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son\\r\\nwished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\\r\\nbeautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played\\r\\ntogether, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\\r\\nwent out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,\\r\\nthat the king’s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus\\r\\nbring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,\\r\\nand said: ‘Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this\\r\\nknife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do\\r\\nnot do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon he went away, and when\\r\\nhe returned next day she had not done it, and said: ‘Why should I shed\\r\\nthe blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?’ The cook once\\r\\nmore said: ‘If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.’ When\\r\\nhe had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her\\r\\nto be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,\\r\\nand when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: ‘Lie down in\\r\\nyour bed, and draw the clothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in\\r\\nand said: ‘Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the\\r\\nplate to him, but the king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ‘You old\\r\\nsinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.\\r\\nYou shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,\\r\\nand shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\\r\\nthroat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\\r\\ninto a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\\r\\nwere ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\\r\\nflames broke forth from his throat. The king’s son remained there a\\r\\nshort while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\\r\\nwere still alive. At length he said to the maiden: ‘I will go home to my\\r\\nown country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ‘Ah,’\\r\\nshe replied, ‘the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land\\r\\nwhere I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as they\\r\\ncould not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed\\r\\ninto a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his\\r\\nown country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower\\r\\nin which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for\\r\\na ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and\\r\\nlooked inside, and cried: ‘Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still\\r\\nalive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ‘I have just eaten, and am still\\r\\nsatisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there. Said he: ‘I am your\\r\\ndear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;\\r\\nbut I am alive still, and will soon set you free.’ Then he descended\\r\\nagain, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a\\r\\nstrange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said\\r\\nyes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to\\r\\nhim, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the\\r\\ndistrict or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game\\r\\nfor him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all\\r\\nthe huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.\\r\\nAnd he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end\\r\\nwhere he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more\\r\\ncame running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.\\r\\nThen they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the\\r\\nking, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having\\r\\nhad none at all for years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\\r\\nhousehold should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\\r\\nthey were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ‘As you are\\r\\nso clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ‘Lord King, your majesty\\r\\nmust excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it,\\r\\nand said: ‘You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst he was sitting\\r\\nthere, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the\\r\\nking’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how\\r\\nit was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,\\r\\nor had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,\\r\\nand said: ‘Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen\\r\\nliving in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?’ But the king\\r\\nreplied: ‘She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will\\r\\nnot have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and said: ‘Gracious lord\\r\\nfather she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away\\r\\nby wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her\\r\\narms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a\\r\\nchicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:\\r\\n‘That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals to be brought, and these the\\r\\ndog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst\\r\\nforth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would\\r\\nlike to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form\\r\\nof the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron,\\r\\nand his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,\\r\\nand ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman\\r\\nspoke further and said: ‘Father, will you see the maiden who brought me\\r\\nup so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,\\r\\nthough her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would\\r\\nlike to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father, I will show her\\r\\nto you in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into\\r\\nhis pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\\r\\nand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.\\r\\nThen the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and\\r\\nwished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\\r\\nbeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\\r\\nto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was\\r\\nled in she ate nothing, and said: ‘The gracious and merciful God who has\\r\\nsupported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three days\\r\\nmore, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white\\r\\ndoves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of\\r\\nheaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged\\r\\nking ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the\\r\\nking’s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden\\r\\nwhom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they\\r\\nare still alive or not, is known to God.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEVER ELSIE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And\\r\\nwhen she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’\\r\\nsaid the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At\\r\\nlength a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;\\r\\nbut he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said\\r\\nthe father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,\\r\\nshe can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’\\r\\n‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When\\r\\nthey were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go\\r\\ninto the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher\\r\\nfrom the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she\\r\\nwent, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she\\r\\nfetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had\\r\\nno need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected\\r\\ninjury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and\\r\\nwhile the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but\\r\\nlooked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a\\r\\npick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left\\r\\nthere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have\\r\\na child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\\r\\nbeer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she\\r\\nsat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\\r\\nmisfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,\\r\\nbut Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:\\r\\n‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and\\r\\nfound her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why\\r\\ndo you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to\\r\\nweep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to\\r\\ndraw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill\\r\\nhim.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down\\r\\nbeside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,\\r\\nas the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the\\r\\nbeer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see\\r\\nwhere Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever\\r\\nElsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you\\r\\nweeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,\\r\\nand we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the\\r\\npick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What\\r\\na clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to\\r\\nhowl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not\\r\\nreturn, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see\\r\\nwhere Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst\\r\\nof their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told\\r\\nher also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it\\r\\ngrew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the\\r\\nmother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept\\r\\nwith them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not\\r\\ncome back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the\\r\\ncellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,\\r\\nand they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and\\r\\nthat Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one\\r\\ninto the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if\\r\\nhe should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very\\r\\ntime when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat\\r\\ndown, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone\\r\\nfor a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be\\r\\nwaiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’\\r\\nWhen he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\\r\\nquite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened\\r\\nthen?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other\\r\\nand have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw\\r\\nsomething to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might\\r\\ndash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to\\r\\nweep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed\\r\\nfor my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and\\r\\nseized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work\\r\\nand earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we\\r\\nmay have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had\\r\\ngone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field\\r\\nwith her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I\\r\\ndo; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then\\r\\nshe drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once\\r\\nmore said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?\\r\\nI will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.\\r\\nHans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said\\r\\nhe: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not\\r\\neven come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,\\r\\nHans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she\\r\\nwas lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought\\r\\na fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she\\r\\nstill went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat\\r\\ndown in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever\\r\\nElsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about\\r\\nher, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was\\r\\nalarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or\\r\\nnot, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer\\r\\nto make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:\\r\\n‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure\\r\\nto know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then\\r\\nshe knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’\\r\\nanswered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:\\r\\n‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the\\r\\npeople heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she\\r\\ncould get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has\\r\\nseen her since.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MISER IN THE BUSH\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\\r\\nhim three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came\\r\\ninto the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;\\r\\nso he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long\\r\\ntime, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my\\r\\ntrouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very\\r\\nsimple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s\\r\\nservice a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to\\r\\nhave, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad\\r\\nfare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself\\r\\nmerry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming\\r\\nover hill and valley.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\\r\\nmet him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make\\r\\nme down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\\r\\nshould I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it\\r\\nall safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man.\\r\\n‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them\\r\\nto me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and\\r\\ngave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have\\r\\nsuch a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every\\r\\npenny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at\\r\\nhis good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I\\r\\nwill have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,\\r\\na fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and\\r\\nthirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf\\r\\nsaid he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,\\r\\nand went his way.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,\\r\\nhe was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old\\r\\nmiser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush\\r\\nsinging away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I\\r\\nwould give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’\\r\\nsaid the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his\\r\\nbow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.\\r\\nThe miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into\\r\\nthe middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the\\r\\nmiser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in\\r\\nthe air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung\\r\\nin rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that\\r\\nthe blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master!\\r\\nmaster! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’\\r\\n‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou\\r\\nart only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the\\r\\nmiser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but\\r\\nhe did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced\\r\\nhim along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till\\r\\nat last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,\\r\\nand had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman\\r\\nsaw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took\\r\\nthe purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\\r\\nbargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\\r\\nplight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\\r\\nhis late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and\\r\\ncomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\\r\\ninto the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\\r\\nback and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his\\r\\nofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\\r\\nwas soon caught and brought up to be tried.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of\\r\\nhis money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the\\r\\ncountryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\\r\\nmatter short by ordering him off to the gallows.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord\\r\\nJudge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the\\r\\nother. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon\\r\\nmy fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for\\r\\nheaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge\\r\\nsaid, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he\\r\\ncould not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But\\r\\nthe countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\\r\\nnote judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and\\r\\nno one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his\\r\\nprisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first\\r\\nbar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and\\r\\nall the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry\\r\\nand pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed\\r\\nto be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him\\r\\nto leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,\\r\\ntill the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him\\r\\nthe hundred florins.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where\\r\\nyou got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole\\r\\nit,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge\\r\\nthat I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman\\r\\nstopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nASHPUTTEL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\\r\\nnigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be\\r\\na good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon\\r\\nafterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;\\r\\nand the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always\\r\\ngood and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful\\r\\nwhite covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the\\r\\nsun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This\\r\\nnew wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;\\r\\nthey were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time\\r\\nfor the poor little girl. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the\\r\\nparlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it;\\r\\naway with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and\\r\\ngave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her\\r\\ninto the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to\\r\\nbring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,\\r\\nthe sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the\\r\\nevening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made\\r\\nto lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her\\r\\nalways dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\\r\\nwife’s daughters what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the\\r\\nfirst; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, child,’ said he\\r\\nto his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear\\r\\nfather, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\\r\\nhomewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes\\r\\nand pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he\\r\\nrode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost\\r\\npushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he\\r\\ngot home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to\\r\\nher mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was\\r\\nwatered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three\\r\\ntimes every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came\\r\\nand built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over\\r\\nher, and brought her whatever she wished for.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\\r\\nlast three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\\r\\na bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they\\r\\ncalled her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie\\r\\nour sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’\\r\\nThen she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help\\r\\ncrying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have\\r\\ngone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard\\r\\nto let her go. ‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to\\r\\nwear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to\\r\\nthe ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of\\r\\nher, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in\\r\\ntwo hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast\\r\\ntoo.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran\\r\\nout at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,\\r\\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\\r\\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\\r\\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\\r\\n  One and all come help me, quick!\\r\\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\\r\\ncame two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\\r\\nheaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.\\r\\nAnd the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\\r\\npick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\\r\\nthem all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish\\r\\nbut left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite\\r\\ndone, and all flew out again at the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought\\r\\nthat now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No, no! you\\r\\nslut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when\\r\\nAshputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s\\r\\ntime pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go\\r\\ntoo.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she\\r\\nshook two dishes of peas into the ashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,\\r\\nand cried out as before:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,\\r\\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\\r\\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\\r\\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\\r\\n  One and all come help me, quick!\\r\\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two\\r\\nturtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,\\r\\nchirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the\\r\\nlittle doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and\\r\\nthen the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain\\r\\ninto the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all\\r\\nwas done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to\\r\\nher mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.\\r\\nBut her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no\\r\\nclothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off\\r\\nshe went with her two daughters to the ball.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\\r\\nsorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\\r\\n  Gold and silver over me!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\\r\\nsilver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\\r\\non, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,\\r\\nand thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\\r\\nbeautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,\\r\\ntaking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced\\r\\nwith her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone\\r\\nelse came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\\r\\ngo home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to\\r\\nyour home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But\\r\\nshe slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\\r\\nthe prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\\r\\nthe door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\\r\\nthe unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\\r\\npigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\\r\\nwithin; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\\r\\nshe always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\\r\\nlamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could\\r\\nthrough the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken\\r\\noff her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird\\r\\nmight carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her\\r\\nlittle grey frock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and\\r\\nsisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\\r\\n  Gold and silver over me!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she\\r\\nhad worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\\r\\nwondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,\\r\\ntook her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to\\r\\ndance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here\\r\\nas before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang\\r\\naway from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house.\\r\\nIn this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and\\r\\nAshputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without\\r\\nbeing seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find\\r\\nout where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said\\r\\nto him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I\\r\\nthink she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to\\r\\nhimself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut\\r\\ndown the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into\\r\\nthe kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped\\r\\ndown on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes\\r\\nback to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey\\r\\nfrock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\\r\\nwent again into the garden, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\\r\\n  Gold and silver over me!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\\r\\nformer one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\\r\\nto the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the\\r\\nking’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to\\r\\ndance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with\\r\\nher, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however,\\r\\nshe again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped\\r\\nher left golden slipper upon the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,\\r\\nand said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper\\r\\nfits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they\\r\\nhad beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden\\r\\nslipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and\\r\\nwanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could\\r\\nnot go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then\\r\\nthe mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you\\r\\nare queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So\\r\\nthe silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,\\r\\nand went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her\\r\\nbeside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel\\r\\nhad planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\\r\\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\\r\\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\\r\\n  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\\r\\nblood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he\\r\\nturned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\\r\\nand said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put\\r\\non the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the\\r\\nshoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it\\r\\nin till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her\\r\\nas his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\\r\\nand sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\\r\\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\\r\\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\\r\\n  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\\r\\nshoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse\\r\\nand brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true bride,’ said he\\r\\nto the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is\\r\\nonly a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\\r\\nsure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But the\\r\\nmother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show\\r\\nherself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed\\r\\nher face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached\\r\\nher the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,\\r\\nand put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made\\r\\nfor her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters\\r\\nwere frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his\\r\\nhorse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the\\r\\nwhite dove sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Home! home! look at the shoe!\\r\\n  Princess! the shoe was made for you!\\r\\n  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\\r\\n  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\\r\\nher right shoulder, and so went home with her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WHITE SNAKE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\\r\\nall the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of\\r\\nthe most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a\\r\\nstrange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,\\r\\nand no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more\\r\\ndish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what\\r\\nwas in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the\\r\\ncover to eat of it until he was quite alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\\r\\naway the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\\r\\ncarrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,\\r\\nhe lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But\\r\\nwhen he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,\\r\\nso he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it\\r\\ntouched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices\\r\\noutside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was\\r\\nthe sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of\\r\\nall kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating\\r\\nthe snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\\r\\nbeautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\\r\\nservant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to\\r\\nbe brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he\\r\\ncould before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked\\r\\nupon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was\\r\\ndismissed with no better answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\\r\\nhow to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting\\r\\ntogether quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they\\r\\nwere making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\\r\\nconfidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.\\r\\nThey were telling one another of all the places where they had been\\r\\nwaddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and\\r\\none said in a pitiful tone: ‘Something lies heavy on my stomach; as\\r\\nI was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s\\r\\nwindow.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the\\r\\nkitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’\\r\\n‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ‘she has spared\\r\\nno trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long\\r\\nenough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the\\r\\nspit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\\r\\namends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him\\r\\nthe best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused\\r\\neverything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\\r\\nhe had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request\\r\\nwas granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he\\r\\nsaw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though\\r\\nit is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must\\r\\nperish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his\\r\\nhorse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with\\r\\ndelight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ‘We will remember you\\r\\nand repay you for saving us!’\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\\r\\nthe sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ‘Why\\r\\ncannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid\\r\\nhorse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\\r\\nmercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to\\r\\nhim: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\\r\\nby their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ‘Out with you, you\\r\\nidle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ‘we cannot find food for\\r\\nyou any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’\\r\\nBut the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and\\r\\ncrying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,\\r\\nand yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the\\r\\ngood young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave\\r\\nit to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their\\r\\nhunger, and cried: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves\\r\\nanother!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long\\r\\nway, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in\\r\\nthe streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The king’s\\r\\ndaughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard\\r\\ntask, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had\\r\\nalready made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth\\r\\nsaw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\\r\\nforgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\\r\\nhis eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the\\r\\nbottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it you will\\r\\nbe thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the\\r\\npeople grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him\\r\\nalone by the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\\r\\nhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very\\r\\nfishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in\\r\\nits mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he\\r\\nhad taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.\\r\\nFull of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him\\r\\nthe promised reward.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\\r\\nbirth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\\r\\ntask. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\\r\\nsacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ‘Tomorrow morning\\r\\nbefore sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be\\r\\nwanting.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible\\r\\nto perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat\\r\\nsorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.\\r\\nBut as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw\\r\\nall the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single\\r\\ngrain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands\\r\\nand thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry\\r\\npicked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was\\r\\namazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.\\r\\nBut she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ‘Although he\\r\\nhas performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had\\r\\nbrought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where\\r\\nthe Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,\\r\\nas long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding\\r\\nit. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to\\r\\na wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in\\r\\nthe branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time\\r\\nthree ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and\\r\\nsaid: ‘We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when\\r\\nwe had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,\\r\\nwe flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life\\r\\nstands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out\\r\\nhomewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter,\\r\\nwho had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in\\r\\ntwo and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,\\r\\nand they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\\r\\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she\\r\\nwanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all\\r\\nseven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,\\r\\nbe on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you\\r\\nall--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but\\r\\nyou will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The\\r\\nkids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go\\r\\naway without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way\\r\\nwith an easy mind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:\\r\\n‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought\\r\\nsomething back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that\\r\\nit was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried\\r\\nthey, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but\\r\\nyour voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a\\r\\nshopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made\\r\\nhis voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the\\r\\nhouse, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here\\r\\nand has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf\\r\\nhad laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them\\r\\nand cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet\\r\\nlike you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I\\r\\nhave hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker\\r\\nhad rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some\\r\\nwhite meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The\\r\\nwolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you\\r\\nwill not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made\\r\\nhis paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at\\r\\nit and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother\\r\\nhas come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the\\r\\nforest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that\\r\\nwe may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws\\r\\nin through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they\\r\\nbelieved that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should\\r\\ncome in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.\\r\\nOne sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the\\r\\nstove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the\\r\\nsixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But\\r\\nthe wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the\\r\\nother he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in\\r\\nthe clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had\\r\\nsatisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a\\r\\ntree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards\\r\\nthe old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw\\r\\nthere! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches\\r\\nwere thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts\\r\\nand pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they\\r\\nwere nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but\\r\\nno one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice\\r\\ncried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and\\r\\nit told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then\\r\\nyou may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.\\r\\nWhen they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored\\r\\nso loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and\\r\\nsaw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah,\\r\\nheavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has\\r\\nswallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to\\r\\nrun home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut\\r\\nopen the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one\\r\\nlittle kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six\\r\\nsprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered\\r\\nno injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them\\r\\ndown whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,\\r\\nand jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now\\r\\ngo and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s\\r\\nstomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged\\r\\nthe stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this\\r\\nstomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the\\r\\ngreatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once\\r\\nstirred.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,\\r\\nand as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to\\r\\ngo to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the\\r\\nstones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried\\r\\nhe:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘What rumbles and tumbles\\r\\n  Against my poor bones?\\r\\n  I thought ‘twas six kids,\\r\\n  But it feels like big stones.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\\r\\nheavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven\\r\\nkids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf\\r\\nis dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with\\r\\ntheir mother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE QUEEN BEE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\\r\\nfortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\\r\\nthat they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a\\r\\nlittle insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when\\r\\nhe had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so\\r\\nyoung and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who\\r\\nwere so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set\\r\\nout on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two\\r\\nelder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor\\r\\nants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the\\r\\nlittle dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not\\r\\nsuffer you to trouble them.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming\\r\\nabout. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the\\r\\ndwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill\\r\\nthem.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was\\r\\nso much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to\\r\\nlight a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.\\r\\nBut the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy\\r\\nthemselves, I cannot let you burn them.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the\\r\\nstables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and\\r\\nno man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they\\r\\ncame to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door\\r\\nwas a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw\\r\\na little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or\\r\\ntwice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then\\r\\nhe rose and came out to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful\\r\\ntable covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and\\r\\ndrunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\\r\\nwhere there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\\r\\nwhich the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the\\r\\nwood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s\\r\\ndaughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,\\r\\nhe who seeks them will be turned into marble.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:\\r\\nbut the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was\\r\\nturned into stone as the tablet had foretold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no\\r\\nbetter than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the\\r\\npearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it\\r\\nwas so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat\\r\\ndown upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants\\r\\n(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\\r\\nit was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\\r\\nheap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be\\r\\nfished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,\\r\\nhe saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they\\r\\ndived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and\\r\\nthe best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and\\r\\nall exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of\\r\\nsugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;\\r\\nso he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf\\r\\nfrom the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat\\r\\nupon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew\\r\\nwhich was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been\\r\\nturned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf\\r\\nmarried the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after\\r\\nher father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:\\r\\nbut still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he\\r\\nhad in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of\\r\\nshoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning\\r\\nto rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and\\r\\nhis heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,\\r\\nleft all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after\\r\\nhe had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his\\r\\ngreat wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The\\r\\ngood man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.\\r\\nHe looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the\\r\\nwhole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that\\r\\nhe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor\\r\\nshoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.\\r\\nIn the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might\\r\\nget up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for\\r\\nwhen he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon\\r\\nin came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought\\r\\nleather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight\\r\\nand found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some\\r\\ntime: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and\\r\\nthe good man soon became thriving and well off again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over\\r\\nthe fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and\\r\\nwatch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for\\r\\nme.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid\\r\\nthemselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up\\r\\nthere, and watched what would happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\\r\\nthey sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work\\r\\nthat was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching\\r\\nand rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all\\r\\nwonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the\\r\\njob was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.\\r\\nThis was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as\\r\\nlightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have\\r\\nmade us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good\\r\\nturn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and\\r\\nindeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to\\r\\nkeep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,\\r\\nand a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and\\r\\ndo you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when\\r\\nall the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the\\r\\nwork that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to\\r\\nwatch what the little elves would do.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the\\r\\nroom, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they\\r\\nsaw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed\\r\\nmightily delighted.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and\\r\\ncapered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced\\r\\nout at the door, and away over the green.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them\\r\\nfrom that time forward, as long as they lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE JUNIPER-TREE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLong, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich\\r\\nman with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but\\r\\nsorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire\\r\\nto have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they\\r\\nremained childless.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.\\r\\nOne winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and\\r\\nas she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the\\r\\nsnow. ‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as\\r\\nblood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew\\r\\nlight within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and\\r\\nshe returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,\\r\\nand the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all\\r\\nthe earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the\\r\\ntrees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly\\r\\nintertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife\\r\\nstood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her\\r\\nheart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that\\r\\nshe fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and\\r\\nshe was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the\\r\\nberries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little\\r\\nwhile later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I\\r\\ndie, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy\\r\\nagain, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and\\r\\nwhen she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy\\r\\nwas so great that she died.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for\\r\\nher. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he\\r\\nstill grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later\\r\\non he married again.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife\\r\\nwas a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother\\r\\nloved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked\\r\\nat the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in\\r\\nthe way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could\\r\\nget the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession\\r\\nof her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She\\r\\ndrove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the\\r\\npoor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left\\r\\nschool to the time he went back.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day the little daughter came running to her mother in the\\r\\nstore-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said\\r\\nthe wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest\\r\\nhad a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one\\r\\ntoo?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he\\r\\ncomes out of school.’\\r\\n\\r\\nJust then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\\r\\nas if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out\\r\\nof her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before\\r\\nyour brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The\\r\\nlittle boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say\\r\\nkindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a\\r\\nwicked look. ‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look! Yes, give\\r\\nme an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him. ‘Come\\r\\nwith me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one\\r\\nout for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged\\r\\nher, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head.\\r\\nThen she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.\\r\\n‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought. So\\r\\nshe went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of\\r\\nher top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and\\r\\nbound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed\\r\\nhim on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring\\r\\na pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is\\r\\nsitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;\\r\\nand when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that\\r\\nfrightened me.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him\\r\\na box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me\\r\\nthat apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the\\r\\near, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran\\r\\ncrying and screaming to her mother. ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off\\r\\nbrother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it,\\r\\nso you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make\\r\\nhim into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him\\r\\ninto puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,\\r\\nand wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no\\r\\nneed of salt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\\r\\n‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\\r\\nblack pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s\\r\\ngreat uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\\r\\nweeks; he is well looked after there.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not\\r\\nbe all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do\\r\\nyou weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more\\r\\npudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\\r\\nher bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\\r\\ntable and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but\\r\\nweep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and\\r\\nshe had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,\\r\\nand she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the\\r\\nbranches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and\\r\\nthen together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for\\r\\njoy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there\\r\\nwas a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful\\r\\nbird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it\\r\\ncould no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the\\r\\nsilk handkerchief and the bones were gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\\r\\nstill alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to\\r\\nthe table and ate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\\r\\nsing:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\\r\\nsong of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got\\r\\nup and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his\\r\\nslippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on\\r\\none foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still\\r\\nheld the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing\\r\\nup at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold\\r\\nchain, and I will sing it you again.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that\\r\\nagain.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then\\r\\nhe alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and\\r\\nsang:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his\\r\\nshirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his\\r\\nhand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the\\r\\ndoor to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it\\r\\nand hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the\\r\\nchildren, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the\\r\\nstreet to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red\\r\\nand green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two\\r\\nbright stars in its head.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must\\r\\ngive me something.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will\\r\\nsee a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched\\r\\nthe shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he\\r\\nwent back to the roof and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw\\r\\nand the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the\\r\\nmill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were\\r\\ntwenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack,\\r\\nhick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click\\r\\nclack.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen one of the men left off,\\r\\n\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n\\r\\ntwo more men left off and listened,\\r\\n\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen four more left off,\\r\\n\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n\\r\\nnow there were only eight at work,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Underneath\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now only five,\\r\\n\\r\\n  the juniper-tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now only one,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\\r\\n\\r\\nthen he looked up and the last one had left off work.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it\\r\\ntoo; sing it again.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that\\r\\nmillstone, and I will sing it again.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the\\r\\nstone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took\\r\\nthe stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the\\r\\ntree and sang--\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the\\r\\nchain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round\\r\\nhis neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm\\r\\nwere coming.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut little Marleen sat and wept and wept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun\\r\\nshines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that\\r\\nmy teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and\\r\\nshe tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the\\r\\ncorner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n\\r\\nthe mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\\r\\nnothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a\\r\\nviolent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\\r\\n\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so\\r\\nmagnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious\\r\\nscent of spice in the air!’\\r\\n\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were in\\r\\nflames!’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the man went out and looked at the bird.\\r\\n\\r\\n She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\\r\\nman’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has\\r\\ngiven me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,\\r\\nand her cap fell from her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the bird began again:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the\\r\\nearth, that I might not hear that song.’\\r\\n\\r\\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\\r\\n\\r\\nthen the woman fell down again as if dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n  My sister loved me best of all;\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will\\r\\ngive me anything.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she went out.\\r\\n\\r\\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\\r\\n  And took my bones that they might lie\\r\\n\\r\\nand he threw down the shoes to her,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\\r\\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and\\r\\ndanced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I\\r\\ncame out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,\\r\\nand he has given me a pair of red shoes.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames\\r\\nof fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten\\r\\nmy misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone\\r\\ndown on her head, and she was crushed to death.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\\r\\nsaw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\\r\\npassed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and\\r\\nlittle Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went\\r\\ninside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TURNIP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and\\r\\nthe other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,\\r\\npulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,\\r\\nand sowed turnips.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and\\r\\nit kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease\\r\\ngrowing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for\\r\\nthere never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it\\r\\nwas so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and\\r\\nthe gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it\\r\\nwould be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What\\r\\nshall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;\\r\\nand for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing\\r\\nperhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it\\r\\nto the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many\\r\\nstrange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you\\r\\nget the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child\\r\\nof fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune;\\r\\nI am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I\\r\\nlaid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a\\r\\nbrother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world\\r\\nknows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no\\r\\nlonger. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your\\r\\nbrother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so\\r\\nrich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the\\r\\ngardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he\\r\\ncould contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he\\r\\ndetermined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a\\r\\nrich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must\\r\\nhave a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so\\r\\nmuch for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to\\r\\ngive in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\\r\\nthe soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.\\r\\nWhen he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;\\r\\nand at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to\\r\\nkill his brother.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\\r\\nlie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have\\r\\nfound a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\\r\\nus.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\\r\\ntogether, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out\\r\\nupon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\\r\\nhorse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\\r\\nprisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\\r\\ncord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime\\r\\nhe worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out\\r\\nhis head.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,\\r\\nwho was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as\\r\\nthe man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good\\r\\nmorning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about\\r\\neverywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came\\r\\nfrom, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here\\r\\nI sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great\\r\\nand wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the\\r\\nschools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man\\r\\ncan know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here\\r\\nI discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws\\r\\nthat control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the\\r\\nhealing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of\\r\\nprecious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel\\r\\nand own the power of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\\r\\n‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to\\r\\nlet me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if\\r\\nvery unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou\\r\\nwilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an\\r\\nhour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown\\r\\nto me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\\r\\nheavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,\\r\\nfor his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give\\r\\nway, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\\r\\nyonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down,\\r\\nopened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend\\r\\nquickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a\\r\\nwhile,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him\\r\\nin head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after\\r\\nwisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he,\\r\\n‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,\\r\\ntill thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow\\r\\nto gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCLEVER HANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To\\r\\nGretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’\\r\\n‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,\\r\\nHans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have\\r\\nsomething given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:\\r\\n‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart\\r\\nhome. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’\\r\\n‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something\\r\\ngiven me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the\\r\\nneedle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You\\r\\nshould have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do\\r\\nbetter next time.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,\\r\\nI’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to\\r\\nGretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is\\r\\ngood?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel\\r\\npresents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans\\r\\ntakes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,\\r\\nmother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What\\r\\ndid you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did\\r\\nGretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck\\r\\nin my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in\\r\\nyour pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,\\r\\nI’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to\\r\\nGretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you\\r\\nbring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents\\r\\nHans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes\\r\\nthe goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it\\r\\nis suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have\\r\\nyou been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she\\r\\ngave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’\\r\\n‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,\\r\\nHans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,\\r\\nwill do better next time.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,\\r\\nI’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to\\r\\nGretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you\\r\\nbring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents\\r\\nHans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.\\r\\nThe dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope\\r\\nin his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good\\r\\nevening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With\\r\\nGretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me\\r\\nsomething.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where\\r\\nis the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took\\r\\nit.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your\\r\\nhead.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll\\r\\nbehave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.\\r\\n‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I\\r\\nbring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans\\r\\nwith a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.\\r\\n‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With\\r\\nGretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something\\r\\ngiven me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the\\r\\ncalf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was\\r\\nill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’\\r\\n‘Never mind, will do better next time.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll\\r\\nbehave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good\\r\\nthing do you bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, but would have something given.’\\r\\nGretel says to Hans: ‘I will go with you.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack, and binds\\r\\nher fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good\\r\\nevening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take\\r\\nher?’ ‘I took her nothing.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me\\r\\nnothing, she came with me.’ ‘Where have you left Gretel?’ ‘I led her by\\r\\nthe rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.’ ‘That\\r\\nwas ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.’ ‘Never\\r\\nmind, will do better.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHans went into the stable, cut out all the calves’ and sheep’s eyes,\\r\\nand threw them in Gretel’s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself\\r\\nloose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE THREE LANGUAGES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he\\r\\nwas stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ‘Hark you,\\r\\nmy son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from\\r\\nhence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall\\r\\nsee what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange town,\\r\\nand remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time,\\r\\nhe came home again, and his father asked: ‘Now, my son, what have you\\r\\nlearnt?’ ‘Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.’ ‘Lord\\r\\nhave mercy on us!’ cried the father; ‘is that all you have learnt? I\\r\\nwill send you into another town, to another master.’ The youth was taken\\r\\nthither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back\\r\\nthe father again asked: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ He answered:\\r\\n‘Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’ Then the father fell into a\\r\\nrage and said: ‘Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and\\r\\nlearnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will\\r\\nsend you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I\\r\\nwill no longer be your father.’ The youth remained a whole year with the\\r\\nthird master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:\\r\\n‘My son, what have you learnt?’ he answered: ‘Dear father, I have this\\r\\nyear learnt what the frogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most\\r\\nfurious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ‘This man\\r\\nis no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him\\r\\nout into the forest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they\\r\\nshould have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,\\r\\nand they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry\\r\\nthem to the old man as a token.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\\r\\nbegged for a night’s lodging. ‘Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ‘if\\r\\nyou will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I\\r\\nwarn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,\\r\\nwhich bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to\\r\\nbe given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district was in\\r\\nsorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to\\r\\nstop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: ‘Just let me\\r\\ngo down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to\\r\\nthem; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself would have it so,\\r\\nthey gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the\\r\\ntower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged\\r\\ntheir tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and\\r\\ndid not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of\\r\\neveryone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of\\r\\nthe castle: ‘The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why\\r\\nthey dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and\\r\\nare obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,\\r\\nand they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise\\r\\nlearnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.’ Then all who\\r\\nheard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him\\r\\nas a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and\\r\\nas he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest\\r\\nfull of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth\\r\\nheard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On\\r\\nthe way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting\\r\\ncroaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they\\r\\nwere saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in\\r\\nRome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among\\r\\nthe cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at\\r\\nlength agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be\\r\\ndistinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was\\r\\ndecided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two\\r\\nsnow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The\\r\\necclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on\\r\\nthe spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were\\r\\nworthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he\\r\\nsaid yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled\\r\\nwhat he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,\\r\\nthat he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and\\r\\ndid not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his\\r\\nshoulders, and said it all in his ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOX AND THE CAT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to\\r\\nherself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the\\r\\nworld,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,\\r\\nhow are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard\\r\\ntimes?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from\\r\\nhead to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give\\r\\nany answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you\\r\\npiebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have\\r\\nyou the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How\\r\\nmany arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the\\r\\ncat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are\\r\\nfollowing me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’\\r\\nsaid the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain\\r\\na sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will\\r\\nteach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter\\r\\nwith four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top\\r\\nof it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your\\r\\nsack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had\\r\\nalready seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the\\r\\ncat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been\\r\\nable to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to\\r\\ngive you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin\\r\\nby learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the\\r\\nfour brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little\\r\\nbundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went\\r\\nall out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came\\r\\nto four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest\\r\\nsaid, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back\\r\\nto this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for\\r\\nhimself.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man\\r\\nmet him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am\\r\\ngoing to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning\\r\\nsome art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and\\r\\nI will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’\\r\\nsaid the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look\\r\\nto earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need\\r\\nnot fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be\\r\\nfair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care\\r\\nanything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man\\r\\nagreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that\\r\\nnothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was\\r\\nsetting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not\\r\\nknow yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a\\r\\nnoble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand\\r\\nthe stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful\\r\\nstar-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave\\r\\nhis master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all\\r\\nthat is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from\\r\\nyou.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him\\r\\nso well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the\\r\\ncraft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to\\r\\ndo. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said\\r\\nthe young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working\\r\\nbackwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’\\r\\n‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,\\r\\nand you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing\\r\\nwhat better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the\\r\\nbeginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,\\r\\n‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as\\r\\nsteel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four\\r\\nbrothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,\\r\\nset off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had\\r\\nhappened to them, and how each had learned some craft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high\\r\\ntree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in\\r\\nthis way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of\\r\\nthis tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are\\r\\nin it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’\\r\\n‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without\\r\\nletting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know\\r\\nanything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the\\r\\ntree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;\\r\\nand it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its\\r\\nease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the\\r\\ntable, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all\\r\\nthe eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and\\r\\nat one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and\\r\\nthe young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall\\r\\nhave done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the\\r\\neggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take\\r\\nthem back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing\\r\\nit. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they\\r\\ncrawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where\\r\\nthe tailor had sewn them together.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your\\r\\ntime, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not\\r\\nknow which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for\\r\\nyou to turn your skill to some account!’\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the\\r\\nking’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king\\r\\nmourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever\\r\\nbrought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four\\r\\nbrothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try\\r\\nwhat we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the\\r\\nprincess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the\\r\\nstar-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I\\r\\nsee her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the\\r\\ndragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for\\r\\na ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the\\r\\nsea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess\\r\\nsitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was\\r\\nlying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’\\r\\nsaid the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’\\r\\n‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away\\r\\nfrom under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know\\r\\nit, but went on snoring.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the\\r\\nship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for\\r\\nhe awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and\\r\\nwanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took\\r\\nup his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down\\r\\ndead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in\\r\\nhis fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea\\r\\nupon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large\\r\\nstitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,\\r\\nand sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked\\r\\nthem together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then\\r\\nreached the ship and got home safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great\\r\\nrejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry\\r\\nher, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then\\r\\nthere arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had\\r\\nnot found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;\\r\\ntherefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of\\r\\nno use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon;\\r\\ntherefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;\\r\\n‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you\\r\\nand the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together\\r\\nagain,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she\\r\\nis mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right;\\r\\nand as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of\\r\\nyou to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great\\r\\ndeal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a\\r\\nreward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this\\r\\nplan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who\\r\\nhad no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,\\r\\nas he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and\\r\\ntook good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the\\r\\nyoung lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have\\r\\nher again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLILY AND THE LION\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a\\r\\njourney; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should\\r\\nbring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels;\\r\\nbut the third, who was called Lily, said, ‘Dear father, bring me a\\r\\nrose.’ Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle\\r\\nof winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of\\r\\nflowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all\\r\\nthree, and bid them goodbye.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and\\r\\njewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the\\r\\nrose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the\\r\\npeople laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in\\r\\nsnow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as\\r\\nhe was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a\\r\\nfine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it\\r\\nseemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the\\r\\nfinest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked\\r\\ndreary and buried in the snow. ‘A lucky hit!’ said he, as he called to\\r\\nhis servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was\\r\\nthere, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce\\r\\nlion, and roared out, ‘Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up\\r\\nalive!’ Then the man said, ‘I knew not that the garden belonged to you;\\r\\ncan nothing save my life?’ ‘No!’ said the lion, ‘nothing, unless you\\r\\nundertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you\\r\\nagree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your\\r\\ndaughter.’ But the man was unwilling to do so and said, ‘It may be my\\r\\nyoungest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when\\r\\nI go home.’ Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, ‘It may\\r\\nperhaps be only a cat or a dog.’ And at last the man yielded with a\\r\\nheavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever\\r\\nshould meet him first on his return.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest\\r\\ndaughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed\\r\\nhim home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was\\r\\nstill more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep,\\r\\nsaying, ‘Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high\\r\\nprice, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has\\r\\nyou, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.’ Then he told her all that\\r\\nhad happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she comforted him, and said, ‘Dear father, the word you have given\\r\\nmust be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let\\r\\nme come safe home again.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her\\r\\nfather, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was\\r\\nan enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the\\r\\nevening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the\\r\\ncastle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The\\r\\nwedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The\\r\\nprince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his\\r\\ncourt; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself,\\r\\nshe knew not whither, till the night came again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter some time he said to her, ‘Tomorrow there will be a great feast in\\r\\nyour father’s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if\\r\\nyou wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.’ Then she\\r\\nrejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set\\r\\nout with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had\\r\\nthought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and\\r\\nstayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to\\r\\ngo to the wedding, she said to the prince, ‘I will not go alone this\\r\\ntime--you must go with me.’ But he would not, and said that it would be\\r\\na very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should\\r\\nfall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be\\r\\nchanged into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven\\r\\nlong years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care\\r\\nno light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and\\r\\ntook with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick\\r\\nwalls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but,\\r\\nunluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the\\r\\nwedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church,\\r\\nand passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light\\r\\nfell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came\\r\\nin and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,\\r\\n‘Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but\\r\\nevery now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you\\r\\nthe way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me\\r\\nfree.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThis said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every\\r\\nnow and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to\\r\\njourney. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked\\r\\nneither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven\\r\\nyears. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time\\r\\nwas fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still\\r\\nfar off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white\\r\\nfeather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.\\r\\n‘Now,’ thought she to herself, ‘no aid of man can be of use to me.’ So\\r\\nshe went to the sun and said, ‘Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill’s\\r\\ntop and the valley’s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?’\\r\\n‘No,’ said the sun, ‘I have not seen it; but I will give thee a\\r\\ncasket--open it when thy hour of need comes.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when\\r\\nthe moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ‘Thou shinest through the\\r\\nnight, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?’\\r\\n‘No,’ said the moon, ‘I cannot help thee but I will give thee an\\r\\negg--break it when need comes.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she\\r\\nraised up her voice to it, and said, ‘Thou blowest through every tree\\r\\nand under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the\\r\\nnight-wind, ‘but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen\\r\\nit.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had\\r\\nnot seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I have seen the white dove--he\\r\\nhas fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the\\r\\nseven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;\\r\\nand the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from\\r\\nyou.’ Then the night-wind said, ‘I will give thee counsel. Go to the\\r\\nRed Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou\\r\\ncomest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and\\r\\nso the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you\\r\\nin their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged\\r\\nlike bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved\\r\\none as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to\\r\\nyour home. I will also give thee this nut,’ continued the night-wind.\\r\\n‘When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will\\r\\nimmediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able\\r\\nto rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole\\r\\nway; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let\\r\\nyou both fall into the sea.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had\\r\\nsaid; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the\\r\\nlion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But\\r\\nno sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized\\r\\nthe prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin’s back, and went off\\r\\ncarrying the prince away with her.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she\\r\\ntook heart and said, ‘As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock\\r\\ncrows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.’ She went on for\\r\\na long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the\\r\\nprincess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and\\r\\nshe heard that the wedding was about to be held. ‘Heaven aid me now!’\\r\\nsaid she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found\\r\\nthat within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it\\r\\non, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and\\r\\nthe dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be\\r\\nsold. ‘Not for gold and silver.’ said she, ‘but for flesh and blood.’\\r\\nThe princess asked what she meant, and she said, ‘Let me speak with the\\r\\nbridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.’\\r\\nAt last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the\\r\\nprince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When\\r\\nevening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into\\r\\nhis chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: ‘I have\\r\\nfollowed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the\\r\\nnight-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome\\r\\nthe dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?’ But the prince all the time\\r\\nslept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like\\r\\nthe whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and\\r\\nwhen she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,\\r\\nand sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of\\r\\nthe egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran\\r\\nout a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then\\r\\nnestled under the old one’s wings, so as to form the most beautiful\\r\\nsight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the\\r\\nbride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth\\r\\nand asked her if she would sell the brood. ‘Not for gold or silver, but\\r\\nfor flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom\\r\\nin his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to\\r\\nwhat she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked\\r\\nthe chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the\\r\\nchamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and\\r\\nhow a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was\\r\\nto come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the\\r\\nsleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what\\r\\nwoes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,\\r\\nhe knew his beloved wife’s voice, and sprang up, and said, ‘You have\\r\\nawakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell\\r\\naround me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent\\r\\nyou to me in a lucky hour.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated\\r\\nthemselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.\\r\\nWhen they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,\\r\\nand immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin\\r\\nrested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found\\r\\ntheir child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their\\r\\ntroubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FOX AND THE HORSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to\\r\\nhim: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him\\r\\nnothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself\\r\\noff out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are\\r\\nstronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the\\r\\nwood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently\\r\\na fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang\\r\\ndown your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the\\r\\nhorse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has\\r\\nforgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I\\r\\ncan no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become\\r\\nstronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I\\r\\nhave of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;\\r\\nlie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be\\r\\ndead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the\\r\\nlion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off\\r\\nlies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of\\r\\nhis carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and\\r\\nwhen they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat\\r\\nhim comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to\\r\\nhis tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your\\r\\nleisure.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThis advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the\\r\\nfox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs\\r\\ntogether and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he\\r\\ncould not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the\\r\\nhorse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,\\r\\nand moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar\\r\\nand bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the\\r\\nhorse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his\\r\\nmaster’s house.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when\\r\\nthe farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou\\r\\nshalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old\\r\\nhorse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BLUE LIGHT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the\\r\\nking faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer\\r\\nbecause of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:\\r\\n‘You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not\\r\\nreceive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me\\r\\nservice for them.’ Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,\\r\\nwent away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the\\r\\nevening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,\\r\\nwhich he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. ‘Do give\\r\\nme one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said he to\\r\\nher, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘Oho!’ she answered, ‘who gives anything to a\\r\\nrun-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you\\r\\nwill do what I wish.’ ‘What do you wish?’ said the soldier. ‘That you\\r\\nshould dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.’ The soldier consented,\\r\\nand next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by\\r\\nthe evening. ‘I see well enough,’ said the witch, ‘that you can do no\\r\\nmore today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for\\r\\nwhich you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.’ The\\r\\nsoldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch\\r\\nproposed that he should stay one night more. ‘Tomorrow, you shall only\\r\\ndo me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old\\r\\ndry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes\\r\\nout, and you shall bring it up again.’ Next day the old woman took him\\r\\nto the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and\\r\\nmade her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he\\r\\ncame near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the\\r\\nblue light away from him. ‘No,’ said he, perceiving her evil intention,\\r\\n‘I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon\\r\\nthe ground.’ The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the\\r\\nwell, and went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue\\r\\nlight went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well\\r\\nthat he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully,\\r\\nthen suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which\\r\\nwas still half full. ‘This shall be my last pleasure,’ thought he,\\r\\npulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the\\r\\nsmoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood\\r\\nbefore him, and said: ‘Lord, what are your commands?’ ‘What my commands\\r\\nare?’ replied the soldier, quite astonished. ‘I must do everything you\\r\\nbid me,’ said the little man. ‘Good,’ said the soldier; ‘then in the\\r\\nfirst place help me out of this well.’ The little man took him by the\\r\\nhand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget\\r\\nto take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the\\r\\ntreasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the\\r\\nsoldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said\\r\\nto the little man: ‘Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before\\r\\nthe judge.’ In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild\\r\\ntom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man\\r\\nreappeared. ‘It is all done,’ said he, ‘and the witch is already hanging\\r\\non the gallows. What further commands has my lord?’ inquired the dwarf.\\r\\n‘At this moment, none,’ answered the soldier; ‘you can return home, only\\r\\nbe at hand immediately, if I summon you.’ ‘Nothing more is needed than\\r\\nthat you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear\\r\\nbefore you at once.’ Thereupon he vanished from his sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the\\r\\nbest inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord\\r\\nfurnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the\\r\\nsoldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin\\r\\nand said: ‘I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me,\\r\\nand left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.’ ‘What am I to\\r\\ndo?’ asked the little man. ‘Late at night, when the king’s daughter is\\r\\nin bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for\\r\\nme.’ The manikin said: ‘That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very\\r\\ndangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.’\\r\\nWhen twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin\\r\\ncarried in the princess. ‘Aha! are you there?’ cried the soldier, ‘get\\r\\nto your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.’ When\\r\\nshe had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he\\r\\nstretched out his feet and said: ‘Pull off my boots,’ and then he\\r\\nthrew them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean\\r\\nand brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without\\r\\nopposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock\\r\\ncrowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her\\r\\nin her bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told\\r\\nhim that she had had a very strange dream. ‘I was carried through the\\r\\nstreets with the rapidity of lightning,’ said she, ‘and taken into a\\r\\nsoldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his\\r\\nroom, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a\\r\\ndream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.’\\r\\n‘The dream may have been true,’ said the king. ‘I will give you a piece\\r\\nof advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the\\r\\npocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and\\r\\nleave a track in the streets.’ But unseen by the king, the manikin was\\r\\nstanding beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when\\r\\nthe sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas\\r\\ncertainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the\\r\\ncrafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there\\r\\nwas. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until\\r\\ncock-crow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was\\r\\nall in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up\\r\\npeas, and saying: ‘It must have rained peas, last night.’ ‘We must think\\r\\nof something else,’ said the king; ‘keep your shoes on when you go to\\r\\nbed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide\\r\\none of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.’ The black manikin\\r\\nheard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to\\r\\nbring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no\\r\\nexpedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found\\r\\nin the soldier’s house it would go badly with him. ‘Do what I bid you,’\\r\\nreplied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged\\r\\nto work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under\\r\\nthe bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter’s\\r\\nshoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the\\r\\nentreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,\\r\\nand thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable\\r\\nthings he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in\\r\\nhis pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of\\r\\nhis dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The\\r\\nsoldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to\\r\\nhim: ‘Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in\\r\\nthe inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.’ His comrade ran\\r\\nthither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone\\r\\nagain, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. ‘Have no\\r\\nfear,’ said the latter to his master. ‘Go wheresoever they take you, and\\r\\nlet them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.’ Next day\\r\\nthe soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge\\r\\ncondemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last\\r\\nfavour of the king. ‘What is it?’ asked the king. ‘That I may smoke one\\r\\nmore pipe on my way.’ ‘You may smoke three,’ answered the king, ‘but do\\r\\nnot imagine that I will spare your life.’ Then the soldier pulled out\\r\\nhis pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths\\r\\nof smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his\\r\\nhand, and said: ‘What does my lord command?’ ‘Strike down to earth that\\r\\nfalse judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has\\r\\ntreated me so ill.’ Then the manikin fell on them like lightning,\\r\\ndarting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by\\r\\nhis cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king\\r\\nwas terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to\\r\\nbe allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his\\r\\ndaughter to wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RAVEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run\\r\\nalone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not\\r\\nquiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens\\r\\nflying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: ‘I wish you\\r\\nwere a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.’\\r\\nScarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was\\r\\nturned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The\\r\\nbird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,\\r\\nand meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard\\r\\na raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew\\r\\nnear, the raven said, ‘I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am now under\\r\\nthe spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’ ‘What\\r\\nam I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go farther into the wood until you\\r\\ncome to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and\\r\\ndrink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into\\r\\na deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the\\r\\nhouse is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.\\r\\nI shall drive there in my carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for\\r\\nthree successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the\\r\\nsecond by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you\\r\\nfail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, ‘Alas! I\\r\\nknow even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable\\r\\nto save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no account touch\\r\\na thing to eat or drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you\\r\\nsomething to eat and drink.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No,’ answered the man, ‘I will neither eat not drink.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you will\\r\\nnot eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink\\r\\ncounts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and\\r\\ndrank.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden\\r\\nand mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of\\r\\nfatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little\\r\\nwhile, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute\\r\\nhis eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,\\r\\nthat all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two\\r\\no’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;\\r\\nbut even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, ‘I\\r\\nknow he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the garden, there she found\\r\\nhim as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out\\r\\nof her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it\\r\\nwas all in vain, he still continued sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and\\r\\ndrink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent\\r\\nentreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to\\r\\nwatch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel\\r\\nso tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could\\r\\nnot stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.\\r\\nAs the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully\\r\\nto herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ She went as before to look\\r\\nfor him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day the old woman said to him, ‘What is this? You are not\\r\\neating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’\\r\\n\\r\\nHe answered, ‘I may not and will not either eat or drink.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,\\r\\nand when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and\\r\\ntook a deep draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in\\r\\nthe garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more overcome\\r\\nwith weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,\\r\\nhe slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be seen approaching,\\r\\nand this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her\\r\\nhorses, were black.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ‘I\\r\\nknow he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’ She\\r\\nfound him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no\\r\\navail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask\\r\\nof wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would\\r\\nnever grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was\\r\\nengraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid\\r\\na letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food\\r\\nand drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:\\r\\n‘I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me\\r\\nfree; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle\\r\\nof Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.’ She then\\r\\nreturned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved\\r\\nat heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven away again,\\r\\nand it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the\\r\\nthings which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it\\r\\nall that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his\\r\\nway and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which\\r\\ndirection he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it\\r\\nand came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for\\r\\nfourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night\\r\\ncame on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again\\r\\nthe next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,\\r\\nthinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a\\r\\nhowling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till\\r\\nit was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then\\r\\nseeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than\\r\\nit really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense\\r\\ngiant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant\\r\\nsees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a\\r\\nwhile he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,\\r\\nhe called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had\\r\\nanything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ‘I\\r\\nwould rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly\\r\\ngive myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to\\r\\nsatisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, ‘I will leave\\r\\nyou in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the\\r\\nbread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,\\r\\nwere still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and\\r\\nate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished his supper\\r\\nthe man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.\\r\\nThe giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,\\r\\nvillages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,\\r\\nbut could not find it. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have larger maps\\r\\nupstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’ but they searched in\\r\\nvain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought\\r\\nhe should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to\\r\\nremain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was\\r\\naway in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him\\r\\nabout the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own\\r\\nmaps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when\\r\\nhe had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and\\r\\nlooked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he\\r\\nfetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until\\r\\nat last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. ‘How shall I\\r\\nbe able to get there?’ asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’ said\\r\\nthe giant, ‘and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I\\r\\nmust then return to look after the child who is in our care.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues\\r\\nof the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to walk the\\r\\nremainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and night\\r\\ntill he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,\\r\\nhowever, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the\\r\\nenchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was\\r\\noverjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but\\r\\nthe sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he\\r\\nfell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was\\r\\ngreatly grieved, and said to himself, ‘I will remain here and wait for\\r\\nher,’ so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for\\r\\na whole year, and every day he saw the king’s daughter driving round her\\r\\ncastle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\\r\\ncalled out to them, ‘God be with you.’ They stopped when they heard the\\r\\ncall, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their\\r\\nfighting, which now became more furious. ‘God be with you,’ he cried\\r\\nagain, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went\\r\\nback to their fighting. A third time he called out, ‘God be with you,’\\r\\nand then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between\\r\\nthe three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so\\r\\nangrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,\\r\\nand that he had but to strike it against any door through which he\\r\\nwished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he\\r\\nhad found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had\\r\\ncaught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even\\r\\nup the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they\\r\\nwould keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would\\r\\nseparate. On hearing this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in\\r\\nexchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,\\r\\nbut something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove\\r\\nwhether all you have told me about your three things is true.’ The\\r\\nrobbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick\\r\\nand the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer\\r\\nvisible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after\\r\\nanother, crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you\\r\\ndeserve; are you satisfied now!’\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of\\r\\nthe castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,\\r\\nand it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the\\r\\nsteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden\\r\\ngoblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still\\r\\nwore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,\\r\\nand threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.\\r\\n‘That is my own ring,’ she exclaimed, ‘and if that is so the man must\\r\\nalso be here who is coming to set me free.’\\r\\n\\r\\nShe sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.\\r\\nMeanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off\\r\\nthe cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and\\r\\ncried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and\\r\\nshe kissed him, and said, ‘Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow\\r\\nwe will celebrate our marriage.’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE GOLDEN GOOSE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\\r\\nDummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\n     [*] Simpleton\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,\\r\\nand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a\\r\\nbottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade\\r\\nhim good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,\\r\\nand let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But\\r\\nthe clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have\\r\\nnone for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing\\r\\nand went on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a\\r\\nfalse stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home\\r\\nand have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,\\r\\nlike the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man\\r\\nmet him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.\\r\\nBut the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be\\r\\ntaken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and\\r\\nwent on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a\\r\\nfew blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be\\r\\ncarried home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father\\r\\nanswered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,\\r\\nyou do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long\\r\\nthat at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting\\r\\nyourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the\\r\\ncinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,\\r\\nand greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out\\r\\nof your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have\\r\\nonly cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit\\r\\ndown and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his\\r\\ncinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good\\r\\nwine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since\\r\\nyou have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will\\r\\ngive you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will\\r\\nfind something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose\\r\\nsitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and\\r\\ntaking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the\\r\\nnight. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were\\r\\ncurious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have\\r\\nliked to have one of its golden feathers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\\r\\nfeather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by\\r\\nthe wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a\\r\\nfeather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she\\r\\nwas held fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the third also came with the like intent, and the others\\r\\nscreamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did\\r\\nnot understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she\\r\\nthought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as\\r\\nshe had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they\\r\\nhad to spend the night with the goose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,\\r\\nwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to\\r\\nit. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,\\r\\nwherever his legs took him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\\r\\nprocession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you\\r\\nrunning across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the\\r\\nsame time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,\\r\\nbut as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself\\r\\nobliged to run behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running\\r\\nbehind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi!\\r\\nyour reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a\\r\\nchristening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but\\r\\nwas also held fast to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers\\r\\ncame with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them\\r\\nand begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had\\r\\nscarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were\\r\\nseven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter\\r\\nwho was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth\\r\\na decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry\\r\\nher. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train\\r\\nbefore the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people\\r\\nrunning on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite\\r\\nloudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have\\r\\nher for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all\\r\\nmanner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink\\r\\na cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could\\r\\ncertainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place\\r\\nwhere he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very\\r\\nsorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so\\r\\nsorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench\\r\\nit; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but\\r\\nthat to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall\\r\\nbe satisfied.’\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge\\r\\nbarrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was\\r\\nout he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more\\r\\nfor his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom\\r\\neveryone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a\\r\\nnew condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain\\r\\nof bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the\\r\\nforest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his\\r\\nbody with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a\\r\\nwhole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger\\r\\nas I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to\\r\\ndie of hunger.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall\\r\\neat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the\\r\\nflour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge\\r\\nmountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,\\r\\nbegan to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.\\r\\nThen Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again\\r\\nsought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on\\r\\nwater. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall\\r\\nhave my daughter for wife.’\\r\\n\\r\\nDummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey\\r\\nman to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,\\r\\nhe said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you\\r\\nthe ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he\\r\\ngave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king\\r\\nsaw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The\\r\\nwedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited\\r\\nhis kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WATER OF LIFE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way\\r\\noff, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill\\r\\nthat nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved\\r\\nat their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very\\r\\nmournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and\\r\\nasked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,\\r\\nand that they were afraid nothing could save him. ‘I know what would,’\\r\\nsaid the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If he could have a\\r\\ndraught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.’ Then\\r\\nthe eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he went to the sick\\r\\nking, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as\\r\\nit was the only thing that could save him. ‘No,’ said the king. ‘I had\\r\\nrather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in\\r\\nyour journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the\\r\\nprince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father this water, he will\\r\\nmake me sole heir to his kingdom.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a\\r\\ndeep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he\\r\\nsaw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a\\r\\nsugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,\\r\\n‘Prince, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to thee, you ugly imp?’ said\\r\\nthe prince haughtily, and rode on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell\\r\\nof ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became\\r\\nnarrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he\\r\\ncould not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his\\r\\nhorse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing\\r\\nround him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was\\r\\nshut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way\\r\\non foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself\\r\\nunable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s\\r\\nreturn, till at last the second son said, ‘Father, I will go in search\\r\\nof the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely\\r\\ndead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The king was\\r\\nat first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.\\r\\nSo he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,\\r\\nand met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the\\r\\nmountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind\\r\\nyour own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully, and rode on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder\\r\\nbrother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the\\r\\nheart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think\\r\\nthemselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son\\r\\nsaid he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should\\r\\nsoon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf\\r\\nmet him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and\\r\\nsaid, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said, ‘I am going in\\r\\nsearch of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:\\r\\ncan you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!’ ‘Do you know\\r\\nwhere it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do\\r\\nnot. Pray tell me if you know.’ ‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly,\\r\\nand are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to\\r\\ngo. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,\\r\\nthat you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand\\r\\nand two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three\\r\\ntimes with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying\\r\\ndown inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they\\r\\nwill let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the\\r\\nWater of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer\\r\\nthe door will shut upon you for ever.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his\\r\\nfriendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on\\r\\nand on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and\\r\\nfound everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at\\r\\nthe third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on\\r\\nthrough the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he\\r\\nsaw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings\\r\\nand put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a\\r\\nsword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a\\r\\nroom where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him\\r\\njoyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound\\r\\nher, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and\\r\\nmarry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life\\r\\nwas in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he\\r\\nwanted before the clock struck twelve.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a\\r\\ndelightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,\\r\\nas he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on\\r\\nthe lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep\\r\\nfell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was\\r\\nstriking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully\\r\\nfrightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full\\r\\nof water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of\\r\\nthe iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him\\r\\nthat it snapped off a piece of his heel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got\\r\\nthe Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed\\r\\nby the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ‘You\\r\\nhave made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole\\r\\narmies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince thought\\r\\nto himself, ‘I cannot go home to my father without my brothers’; so he\\r\\nsaid, ‘My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who\\r\\nset out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?’\\r\\n‘I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,’ said the dwarf,\\r\\n‘because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.’\\r\\nThe prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set\\r\\nthem free, though unwillingly, saying, ‘Beware of them, for they have\\r\\nbad hearts.’ Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,\\r\\nand told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water\\r\\nof Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful\\r\\nprincess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to\\r\\nwait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a\\r\\ncountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was\\r\\nfeared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land\\r\\nthe bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the\\r\\nwonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus the\\r\\nkingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he\\r\\nbefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage\\r\\nthe two eldest said to themselves, ‘Our brother has got the water which\\r\\nwe could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the\\r\\nkingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of envy and revenge, and\\r\\nagreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was\\r\\nfast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it\\r\\nfor themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his cup\\r\\nto the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,\\r\\nhad he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was\\r\\nbefore; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest\\r\\nfor what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,\\r\\nbut that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.\\r\\nHe no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his\\r\\nsickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.\\r\\nThen they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ‘Well,\\r\\nbrother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble\\r\\nand we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did\\r\\nnot you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take\\r\\naway your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better\\r\\nsay nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you\\r\\nsay; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:\\r\\nbut be quiet, and we will let you off.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought\\r\\nthat he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court\\r\\ntogether, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to\\r\\nbe put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one\\r\\nday, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they\\r\\nwere alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that\\r\\nthe prince said, ‘My friend, what is the matter with you?’ ‘I cannot and\\r\\ndare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,\\r\\n‘Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will\\r\\nforgive you.’ ‘Alas!’ said the huntsman; ‘the king has ordered me to\\r\\nshoot you.’ The prince started at this, and said, ‘Let me live, and I\\r\\nwill change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my\\r\\nfather, and do you give me your shabby one.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said\\r\\nthe huntsman; ‘I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not\\r\\nhave shot you.’ Then he took the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby\\r\\none, and went away through the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court,\\r\\nwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now\\r\\nall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword\\r\\nand loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their\\r\\npeople. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son might\\r\\nstill be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that my son were still\\r\\nalive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ‘He is still alive,’\\r\\nsaid the huntsman; ‘and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him\\r\\ngo in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the king was\\r\\noverwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that\\r\\nif his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should\\r\\ncome back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining\\r\\ngold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode\\r\\nstraight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must\\r\\nlet him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was\\r\\nnot the right one; and that they must send him away at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\\r\\nhaste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set\\r\\nher free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with\\r\\nher. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to\\r\\nlook at it, and he thought to himself, ‘It is a pity to ride upon this\\r\\nbeautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of\\r\\nit. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road\\r\\nhe took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go\\r\\nabout his business.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when\\r\\nhe came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,\\r\\nhe stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to\\r\\nhimself, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he\\r\\ntoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to\\r\\nthe gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too\\r\\nmust go away about his business; and away he went.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest\\r\\nin which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and set out in\\r\\nsearch of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all\\r\\nthe way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was\\r\\nmade of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the\\r\\ngate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said\\r\\nhe was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the\\r\\nkingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told\\r\\nhim she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to\\r\\nhave him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went\\r\\nto visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;\\r\\nhow his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne\\r\\nall those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very\\r\\nangry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,\\r\\nand got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they\\r\\nwent to nobody knew and nobody cared.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his\\r\\nkingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.\\r\\nAnd young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once\\r\\non the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the\\r\\nsugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\n  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.\\r\\n  And all the good people they danced and they sung,\\r\\n  And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE TWELVE HUNTSMEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And\\r\\nwhen he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father\\r\\nlay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.\\r\\nThen he said to his beloved: ‘I must now go and leave you, I give you\\r\\na ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch\\r\\nyou.’ So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\\r\\ndangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: ‘Dear son, I wished\\r\\nto see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,’ and\\r\\nhe named a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was\\r\\nin such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ‘Yes,\\r\\ndear father, your will shall be done,’ and thereupon the king shut his\\r\\neyes, and died.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of\\r\\nmourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given\\r\\nhis father, and caused the king’s daughter to be asked in marriage, and\\r\\nshe was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted\\r\\nso much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father\\r\\nsaid to her: ‘Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have\\r\\nwhatsoever you will.’ She thought for a moment and said: ‘Dear father,\\r\\nI wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.’\\r\\nThe father said: ‘If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,’\\r\\nand he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven\\r\\nyoung maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,\\r\\nfigure, and size.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen they came to the king’s daughter, she had twelve suits of\\r\\nhuntsmen’s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put\\r\\non the huntsmen’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.\\r\\nThereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,\\r\\nand rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.\\r\\nThen she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of\\r\\nthem into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but\\r\\nas they were such handsome fellows, he said: ‘Yes,’ and that he would\\r\\nwillingly take them, and now they were the king’s twelve huntsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew\\r\\nall concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he\\r\\nsaid to the king: ‘You think you have twelve huntsmen?’ ‘Yes,’ said the\\r\\nking, ‘they are twelve huntsmen.’ The lion continued: ‘You are mistaken,\\r\\nthey are twelve girls.’ The king said: ‘That cannot be true! How\\r\\nwill you prove that to me?’ ‘Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the\\r\\nante-chamber,’ answered the lion, ‘and then you will soon see. Men have\\r\\na firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls\\r\\ntrip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.’ The king\\r\\nwas well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was, however, a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen,\\r\\nand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to\\r\\nthem and repeated everything, and said: ‘The lion wants to make the king\\r\\nbelieve that you are girls.’ Then the king’s daughter thanked him, and\\r\\nsaid to her maidens: ‘Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.’\\r\\nSo next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before\\r\\nhim, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they\\r\\nstepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not\\r\\none of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,\\r\\nand the king said to the lion: ‘You have lied to me, they walk just like\\r\\nmen.’ The lion said: ‘They have been informed that they were going to\\r\\nbe put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve\\r\\nspinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to\\r\\nthem and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.’\\r\\nThe king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the\\r\\nante-chamber.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,\\r\\nand disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’s daughter\\r\\nsaid to her eleven girls: ‘Show some constraint, and do not look round\\r\\nat the spinning-wheels.’ And next morning when the king had his twelve\\r\\nhuntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once\\r\\nlooked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:\\r\\n‘You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the\\r\\nspinning-wheels.’ The lion replied: ‘They have restrained themselves.’\\r\\nThe king, however, would no longer believe the lion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his\\r\\nliking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that\\r\\nonce when they were out hunting, news came that the king’s bride was\\r\\napproaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that\\r\\nher heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The\\r\\nking thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,\\r\\nwanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which\\r\\nhe had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he\\r\\nrecognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and\\r\\nwhen she opened her eyes he said: ‘You are mine, and I am yours, and\\r\\nno one in the world can alter that.’ He sent a messenger to the other\\r\\nbride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife\\r\\nalready, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new\\r\\none. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken\\r\\ninto favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\\r\\nyoung, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then\\r\\nmaking a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth,\\r\\nin the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were\\r\\nlost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that\\r\\nnothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often\\r\\nwent in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of\\r\\nhis trouble.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no\\r\\ngreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like\\r\\nto be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,\\r\\nblack dwarf. ‘Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the\\r\\nmerchant; ‘what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ‘If you would do me\\r\\nany good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. ‘Who knows but\\r\\nI may?’ said the little man: ‘tell me what ails you, and perhaps you\\r\\nwill find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how all his\\r\\nwealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left\\r\\nbut that little plot of land. ‘Oh, trouble not yourself about that,’\\r\\nsaid the dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence,\\r\\nwhatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much\\r\\nas you please.’ The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask;\\r\\nthat it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that\\r\\nsort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and\\r\\nsigned and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he\\r\\ncrept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in\\r\\nhis face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and\\r\\nhorror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no\\r\\ngold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke\\r\\nthat the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money\\r\\ncame, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look\\r\\nfor some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and\\r\\nthere, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the\\r\\nfloor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about\\r\\nhis son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew\\r\\nnear the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad\\r\\nand thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The\\r\\nboy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for\\r\\nsome time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it,\\r\\nsold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the\\r\\ntwelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel\\r\\nsaid, ‘Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be\\r\\ntoo much for the little man.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\\r\\nagreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself\\r\\nand his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,\\r\\nand walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way\\r\\nto get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At\\r\\nlast the boy said to him. ‘Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or\\r\\nwhat do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that\\r\\nwas fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what\\r\\ngood luck was in store for him. ‘Have you brought me what you said you\\r\\nwould?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but\\r\\nHeinel said again, ‘What do you want here?’ The dwarf said, ‘I come to\\r\\ntalk with your father, not with you.’ ‘You have cheated and taken in my\\r\\nfather,’ said the son; ‘pray give him up his bond at once.’ ‘Fair and\\r\\nsoftly,’ said the little old man; ‘right is right; I have paid my money,\\r\\nand your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me\\r\\nhave what I paid it for.’ ‘You must have my consent to that first,’ said\\r\\nHeinel, ‘so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.’ The old\\r\\nman grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad\\r\\nto get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk,\\r\\nthey came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and\\r\\nthat so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the\\r\\nfairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed\\r\\nhis own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed\\r\\nfriend, who seemed so anxious for his company.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\\r\\nHeinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard\\r\\nby; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he\\r\\nshould thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and\\r\\nweather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat,\\r\\nbut before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side\\r\\nlow in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and\\r\\nwent home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at\\r\\nany rate he had had his revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\\r\\nfriend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\\r\\nyoung man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown\\r\\nland. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle\\r\\nbut empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. ‘Here,’ said he to\\r\\nhimself, ‘must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.’ So he once\\r\\nmore searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white\\r\\nsnake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad\\r\\nto see him, and said, ‘Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve\\r\\nlong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she\\r\\npromised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:\\r\\ntheir faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.\\r\\nThey will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do\\r\\nwhat they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only\\r\\nspeak not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go away. The second\\r\\nnight twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who\\r\\nwill even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their\\r\\npower is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the\\r\\nWater of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life\\r\\nand health.’ And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and\\r\\nspoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his\\r\\nneck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle,\\r\\nthe wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden\\r\\nMountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus\\r\\neight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his\\r\\nfather; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was\\r\\nagainst his going, and said, ‘I know well that misfortunes will come\\r\\nupon us if you go.’ However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his\\r\\ngoing away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ‘Take this ring, and\\r\\nput it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise\\r\\nnever to make use of it to bring me hence to your father’s house.’ Then\\r\\nhe said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and\\r\\nwished himself near the town where his father lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would\\r\\nnot let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a\\r\\nneighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock,\\r\\nand thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father’s\\r\\nhouse, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him,\\r\\nand said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long\\r\\nsince dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would\\r\\nnot even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that\\r\\nhe was his son, and said, ‘Is there no mark by which you would know me\\r\\nif I am really your son?’ ‘Yes,’ said his mother, ‘our Heinel had a mark\\r\\nlike a raspberry on his right arm.’ Then he showed them the mark, and\\r\\nthey knew that what he had said was true.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was\\r\\nmarried to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant\\r\\nsaid, ‘that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels\\r\\nabout in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this the son was vexed; and forgetting\\r\\nhis word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an\\r\\ninstant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had\\r\\nbroken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to\\r\\nsoothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in\\r\\ntruth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her\\r\\nthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat\\r\\nhimself down, and said, ‘I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my\\r\\nhead in your lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as he had fallen asleep,\\r\\nhowever, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and\\r\\nwished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke\\r\\nhe found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.\\r\\n‘I can never go back to my father’s house,’ said he; ‘they would say I\\r\\nam a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to\\r\\nmy kingdom.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSo saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\\r\\ngiants were sharing their father’s goods; and as they saw him pass they\\r\\ncried out and said, ‘Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods\\r\\nbetween us.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s head whenever\\r\\nthe wearer gave the words, ‘Heads off!’; a cloak that made the owner\\r\\ninvisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that\\r\\ncarried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let\\r\\nhim try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value\\r\\nupon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly,\\r\\nand in a moment he was a fly. ‘The cloak is very well,’ said he: ‘now\\r\\ngive me the sword.’ ‘No,’ said they; ‘not unless you undertake not to\\r\\nsay, “Heads off!” for if you do we are all dead men.’ So they gave it\\r\\nhim, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;\\r\\nand the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at\\r\\nthe Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left\\r\\nbehind with no goods to share or quarrel about.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and\\r\\nthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry another\\r\\nhusband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the\\r\\ncastle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one\\r\\nsaw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it\\r\\naway and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he\\r\\ntook it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and\\r\\ndrink, her plate and cup were always empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber\\r\\nalone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. ‘Alas!’ said\\r\\nshe to herself, ‘was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment\\r\\nstill seem to bind me?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘False and fickle one!’ said he. ‘One indeed came who set thee free, and\\r\\nhe is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to\\r\\nhave had such treatment from thee?’ Then he went out and sent away the\\r\\ncompany, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back\\r\\nto the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.\\r\\nHowever, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them\\r\\nif they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried\\r\\nto seize him; but he drew his sword. ‘Heads Off!’ cried he; and with the\\r\\nword the traitors’ heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king\\r\\nof the Golden Mountain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDOCTOR KNOWALL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with\\r\\ntwo oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two\\r\\ntalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that\\r\\nthe doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he\\r\\nate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly\\r\\nhave been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length\\r\\ninquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,\\r\\n‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the\\r\\nfirst place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on\\r\\nthe frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into\\r\\nmoney, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to\\r\\nmedicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I\\r\\nam Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The\\r\\npeasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored\\r\\npeople awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money\\r\\nstolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such\\r\\na village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had\\r\\nthe horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and\\r\\nasked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was\\r\\nto go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my\\r\\nwife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a\\r\\nseat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came\\r\\nto the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to\\r\\nsit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated\\r\\nhimself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a\\r\\ndish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,\\r\\nthat was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first\\r\\ndish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is\\r\\nthe first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said\\r\\nto his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he\\r\\nsaid I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was\\r\\nforced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,\\r\\nand said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,\\r\\nand he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the\\r\\npeasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry\\r\\nin a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to\\r\\nshow his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there\\r\\nwere crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and\\r\\ncried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he\\r\\nknows it; he must also know who has the money!’\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the\\r\\ndoctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore\\r\\nhe went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen\\r\\nthe money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a\\r\\nheavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he\\r\\ndid they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was\\r\\nconcealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,\\r\\nsat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book\\r\\nwhere the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the\\r\\nstove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still\\r\\nand opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and\\r\\nlooked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I\\r\\nknow you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the\\r\\nstove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,\\r\\ncrying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord\\r\\nwhere the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received\\r\\nfrom both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SEVEN RAVENS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.\\r\\nAlthough the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that\\r\\nthey thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be\\r\\nchristened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some\\r\\nwater, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at\\r\\ndrawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their\\r\\npitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at\\r\\none another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the\\r\\nmeantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the\\r\\nyoung men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have\\r\\nforgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited\\r\\nstill longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished\\r\\nthem all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he\\r\\nheard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as\\r\\nblack as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish\\r\\nso fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and\\r\\ncomforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons\\r\\nwith his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day\\r\\nmore beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for\\r\\nher father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one\\r\\nday by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said\\r\\nthey, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers\\r\\nshould have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went\\r\\nto her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what\\r\\nhad become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but\\r\\nsaid it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent\\r\\ncause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and\\r\\nthought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;\\r\\nand she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole\\r\\naway, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever\\r\\nthey might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother\\r\\nhad given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little\\r\\npitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool\\r\\nto rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and\\r\\njourneyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,\\r\\nbut the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to\\r\\nthe moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh\\r\\nand blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the\\r\\nstars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat\\r\\nupon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a\\r\\nlittle piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of\\r\\nwood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,\\r\\nand there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,\\r\\nrolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the\\r\\nglass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little\\r\\npiece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and\\r\\nshe saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?\\r\\nShe wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the\\r\\nglass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her\\r\\npocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the\\r\\npiece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you\\r\\nseeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she.\\r\\nThen the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait\\r\\ntill they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their\\r\\ndinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and\\r\\ntheir drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and\\r\\nout of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each\\r\\nlittle glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had\\r\\nbrought with her fall into the last glass.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the\\r\\ndwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to\\r\\neat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said\\r\\none after the other,\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my\\r\\nlittle glass?’\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Caw! Caw! well I ween\\r\\n  Mortal lips have this way been.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the\\r\\nring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,\\r\\nand said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be\\r\\nfree.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door\\r\\nall the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all\\r\\nthe ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each\\r\\nother, and went merrily home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE WEDDING OF MRS FOX\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFIRST STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that\\r\\nhis wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He\\r\\nstretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved\\r\\nas if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,\\r\\nand her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it\\r\\nbecame known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.\\r\\nThe maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went\\r\\nand opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘What may you be about, Miss Cat?\\r\\n  Do you sleep or do you wake?’\\r\\n\\r\\nShe answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,\\r\\n  Would you know what I am making?\\r\\n  I am boiling warm beer with butter,\\r\\n  Will you be my guest for supper?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid\\r\\nreplied:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘She is sitting in her room,\\r\\n  Moaning in her gloom,\\r\\n  Weeping her little eyes quite red,\\r\\n  Because old Mr Fox is dead.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo\\r\\nher.’ ‘Certainly, young sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\\r\\n  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\\r\\n ‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’\\r\\n ‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.\\r\\n ‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’\\r\\n ‘What does he look like, my dear?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered\\r\\nthe cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘Then I will not have him.’\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there\\r\\nwas another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs\\r\\nFox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After\\r\\nthis still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they\\r\\nwere all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like\\r\\nold Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,\\r\\n  And carry old Mr Fox outside.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred\\r\\nunder the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs\\r\\nFox out of the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSECOND STORY\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the\\r\\ndoor, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The\\r\\nwolf greeted her, and said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,\\r\\n  How comes it that alone you sit?\\r\\n  What are you making good?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cat replied:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,\\r\\n  Will you be my guest, and eat?’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘No, thank you, Mrs Cat,’ answered the wolf. ‘Is Mrs Fox not at home?’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cat said:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘She sits upstairs in her room,\\r\\n  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,\\r\\n  Bewailing her trouble so sore,\\r\\n  For old Mr Fox is no more.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wolf answered:\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘If she’s in want of a husband now,\\r\\n  Then will it please her to step below?’\\r\\n  The cat runs quickly up the stair,\\r\\n  And lets her tail fly here and there,\\r\\n  Until she comes to the parlour door.\\r\\n  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:\\r\\n ‘Are you within, good Mistress Fox?\\r\\n  If you’re in want of a husband now,\\r\\n  Then will it please you to step below?\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs Fox asked: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed\\r\\nmouth?’ ‘No,’ answered the cat. ‘Then he won’t do for me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and\\r\\nall the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good\\r\\nqualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the\\r\\ncat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young\\r\\nfox. Then Mrs Fox said: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a\\r\\nlittle pointed mouth?’ ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has.’ ‘Then let him come\\r\\nupstairs,’ said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding\\r\\nfeast.\\r\\n\\r\\n ‘Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\\r\\n  Up with the window, fling out my old man!\\r\\n  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,\\r\\n  Yet of his wife he never thought,\\r\\n  But ate up every one he caught.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much\\r\\nrejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing\\r\\nstill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE SALAD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,\\r\\nthere came up a little old woman, and said to him, ‘Good day, good day;\\r\\nyou seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me\\r\\nsomething to eat.’ The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in\\r\\nhis pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but\\r\\nshe took hold of him, and said, ‘Listen, my friend, to what I am going\\r\\nto tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after\\r\\na little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds\\r\\nsitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down\\r\\ndead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when\\r\\nyou wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to\\r\\nbe. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will\\r\\nfind a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It\\r\\nis the bird’s heart that will bring you this good luck.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ‘If all this does\\r\\nhappen, it will be a fine thing for me.’ When he had gone a hundred\\r\\nsteps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him,\\r\\nand looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills\\r\\nand feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if\\r\\neach wished to have it himself. ‘Well,’ said the huntsman, ‘this is\\r\\nwonderful; this happens just as the old woman said’; then he shot into\\r\\nthe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the\\r\\nflock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.\\r\\nThen the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took\\r\\nout the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay\\r\\nthe piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and\\r\\nindeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and\\r\\nat last thought to himself, ‘Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am\\r\\nat home? I will go out into the world and look about me.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his\\r\\nneck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through\\r\\na thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow,\\r\\nand at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young\\r\\nlady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and\\r\\nsaid to the young lady, ‘There is a young man coming out of the wood who\\r\\ncarries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child,\\r\\nfor it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird’s heart that\\r\\nbrings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.’ Meantime the\\r\\nhuntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, ‘I\\r\\nhave been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle\\r\\nand rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want’;\\r\\nbut the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful\\r\\nlady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was\\r\\nnot long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else\\r\\nbut looking at the lady’s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.\\r\\nThen the old woman said, ‘Now is the time for getting the bird’s heart.’\\r\\nSo the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his\\r\\npillow, for it lay now under the young lady’s, and the old woman took it\\r\\naway every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his\\r\\nprize.\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Well,’ said the old witch, ‘we have got the bird’s heart, but not the\\r\\nwishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.’ ‘Let us leave him that,’\\r\\nsaid the young lady; ‘he has already lost his wealth.’ Then the witch\\r\\nwas very angry, and said, ‘Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful\\r\\nthing, and I must and will have it.’ So she did as the old woman told\\r\\nher, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and\\r\\nseemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ‘What makes you so sad?’\\r\\n‘Alas! dear sir,’ said she, ‘yonder lies the granite rock where all the\\r\\ncostly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I\\r\\nthink of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only\\r\\nthe birds and the flies--man cannot.’ ‘If that’s all your grief,’ said\\r\\nthe huntsman, ‘I’ll take you there with all my heart’; so he drew her under\\r\\nhis cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they\\r\\nwere both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were\\r\\ndelighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch\\r\\nmade a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, ‘Let us\\r\\nsit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand\\r\\nany longer.’ So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and\\r\\nfell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from\\r\\nhis shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished\\r\\nherself home again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him\\r\\nalone on the wild rock, he said, ‘Alas! what roguery there is in the\\r\\nworld!’ and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to\\r\\ndo. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as\\r\\nhe saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ‘I can only\\r\\nsave myself by feigning to be asleep’; so he laid himself down as if he\\r\\nwere in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed\\r\\nhim with his foot, and said, ‘What worm is this that lies here curled\\r\\nup?’ ‘Tread upon him and kill him,’ said the second. ‘It’s not worth the\\r\\ntrouble,’ said the third; ‘let him live, he’ll go climbing higher up the\\r\\nmountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.’ And they\\r\\npassed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they\\r\\nwere gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat\\r\\nthere a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a\\r\\nwhirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden,\\r\\nand he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he looked around him, and said, ‘I wish I had something to eat, if\\r\\nnot I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples\\r\\nnor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.’ At last he\\r\\nthought to himself, ‘I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen\\r\\nme.’ So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he\\r\\nswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with\\r\\nhorror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very\\r\\nhungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came\\r\\nto another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt\\r\\nanother change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to\\r\\nhave found his old shape again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\\r\\nwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and\\r\\nthe bad salad, and thought to himself, ‘This will help me to my fortune\\r\\nagain, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.’ So he\\r\\nwent away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering\\r\\nabout a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over\\r\\nbrown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into\\r\\nthe castle and asked for a lodging; ‘I am so tired,’ said he, ‘that I\\r\\ncan go no farther.’ ‘Countryman,’ said the witch, ‘who are you? and what\\r\\nis your business?’ ‘I am,’ said he, ‘a messenger sent by the king to\\r\\nfind the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky\\r\\nenough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun\\r\\nscorches so that it begins to wither, and I don’t know that I can carry\\r\\nit farther.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they\\r\\nlonged to taste it, and said, ‘Dear countryman, let us just taste it.’\\r\\n‘To be sure,’ answered he; ‘I have two heads of it with me, and will\\r\\ngive you one’; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the\\r\\nwitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was\\r\\nready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves\\r\\nimmediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed\\r\\nwhen she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the\\r\\nform of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing\\r\\nthe salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a\\r\\nwish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she\\r\\nalso was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish\\r\\nwith the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with\\r\\nthe beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she\\r\\nlonged to taste it, she said, ‘I don’t know where the salad can be.’\\r\\nThen he thought something must have happened, and said, ‘I will go\\r\\ninto the kitchen and see.’ And as he went he saw two asses in the court\\r\\nrunning about, and the salad lying on the ground. ‘All right!’ said\\r\\nhe; ‘those two have had their share.’ Then he took up the rest of\\r\\nthe leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady,\\r\\nsaying, ‘I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.’\\r\\nSo she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they\\r\\nmight know him. ‘Now you shall be paid for your roguery,’ said he; and\\r\\ntied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he\\r\\ncame to a mill and knocked at the window. ‘What’s the matter?’ said the\\r\\nmiller. ‘I have three tiresome beasts here,’ said the other; ‘if you\\r\\nwill take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you,\\r\\nI will pay you whatever you ask.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the miller;\\r\\n‘but how shall I treat them?’ Then the huntsman said, ‘Give the old\\r\\none stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was\\r\\nthe servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give\\r\\nthe youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and\\r\\nno stripes’: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.\\r\\nAfter this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he\\r\\nwanted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass\\r\\nwas dead; ‘The other two,’ said he, ‘are alive and eat, but are so\\r\\nsorrowful that they cannot last long.’ Then the huntsman pitied them,\\r\\nand told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he\\r\\ngave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady\\r\\nfell upon her knees before him, and said, ‘O dearest huntsman! forgive\\r\\nme all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was\\r\\nagainst my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak\\r\\nhangs up in the closet, and as for the bird’s heart, I will give it you\\r\\ntoo.’ But he said, ‘Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean\\r\\nto make you my wife.’ So they were married, and lived together very\\r\\nhappily till they died.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,\\r\\nand could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither\\r\\nlearn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:\\r\\n‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything\\r\\nhad to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but\\r\\nif his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the\\r\\nnight-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal\\r\\nplace, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me\\r\\nshudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at\\r\\nnight which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh,\\r\\nit makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and listened with\\r\\nthe rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. ‘They are\\r\\nalways saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not\\r\\nmake me shudder,’ thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I\\r\\nunderstand nothing!’\\r\\n\\r\\nNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken to me,\\r\\nyou fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you\\r\\ntoo must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your\\r\\nbrother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’ ‘Well, father,’ he\\r\\nreplied, ‘I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but\\r\\nbe managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don’t understand\\r\\nthat at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and\\r\\nthought to himself: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!\\r\\nHe will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to\\r\\nbe a sickle must bend himself betimes.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it is to\\r\\nshudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father\\r\\nbewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward\\r\\nin every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’\\r\\nsaid he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he\\r\\nactually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the\\r\\nsexton, ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon\\r\\npolish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will\\r\\ntrain the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into his house,\\r\\nand he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke\\r\\nhim at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and\\r\\nring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought he,\\r\\nand secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of\\r\\nthe tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell\\r\\nrope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding\\r\\nhole. ‘Who is there?’ cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did\\r\\nnot move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the boy, ‘or take yourself\\r\\noff, you have no business here at night.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might\\r\\nthink he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do you want\\r\\nhere?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the\\r\\nsteps!’ The sexton thought: ‘He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’\\r\\nuttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy\\r\\ncalled to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,\\r\\nhe ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell\\r\\ndown the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he\\r\\nrang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and\\r\\nfell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but\\r\\nhe did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,\\r\\nand asked: ‘Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower\\r\\nbefore you did.’ ‘No, I don’t know,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was\\r\\nstanding by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he\\r\\nwould neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,\\r\\nand threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.\\r\\nI should be sorry if it were.’ The woman ran away and found her husband,\\r\\nwho was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the\\r\\nboy’s father, ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great\\r\\nmisfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his\\r\\nleg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The father was\\r\\nterrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What wicked tricks\\r\\nare these?’ said he. ‘The devil must have put them into your head.’\\r\\n‘Father,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was\\r\\nstanding there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know\\r\\nwho it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go\\r\\naway.’ ‘Ah,’ said the father, ‘I have nothing but unhappiness with you.\\r\\nGo out of my sight. I will see you no more.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I\\r\\ngo forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,\\r\\nunderstand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’ spoke\\r\\nthe father, ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.\\r\\nTake these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you\\r\\ncome, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.’\\r\\n‘Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than\\r\\nthat, I can easily keep it in mind.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\\r\\npocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\\r\\nhimself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man\\r\\napproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\\r\\nhimself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could\\r\\nsee the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there is the tree where\\r\\nseven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning\\r\\nhow to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will\\r\\nsoon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered\\r\\nthe youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as\\r\\nthat, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the\\r\\nmorning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and\\r\\nwaited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,\\r\\nbut at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he\\r\\ncould not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each\\r\\nother, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:\\r\\n‘If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and\\r\\nsuffer!’ And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed\\r\\nup, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.\\r\\nThen he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm\\r\\nthemselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught\\r\\ntheir clothes. So he said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’ The\\r\\ndead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their\\r\\nrags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: ‘If you will not\\r\\ntake care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung\\r\\nthem up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell\\r\\nasleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have\\r\\nthe fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’\\r\\nanswered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open\\r\\ntheir mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which\\r\\nthey had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not\\r\\nget the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has\\r\\nnever come my way before.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to\\r\\nhimself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A\\r\\nwaggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who are\\r\\nyou?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: ‘From\\r\\nwhence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may\\r\\nnot tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your\\r\\nteeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but\\r\\nno one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the\\r\\nwaggoner. ‘Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’ The\\r\\nyouth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn\\r\\nwhere they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour\\r\\nthe youth again said quite loudly: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could\\r\\nbut shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is\\r\\nyour desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,\\r\\nbe silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost\\r\\ntheir lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as\\r\\nthese should never see the daylight again.’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\\r\\nthis purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have\\r\\nno rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a\\r\\nhaunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,\\r\\nif he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that\\r\\nhe who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the\\r\\nmost beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great\\r\\ntreasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would\\r\\nthen be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men\\r\\nhad gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the\\r\\nyouth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will\\r\\nwillingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ‘You may\\r\\nask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must\\r\\nbe things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a\\r\\nturning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king had these things carried into the castle for him during the\\r\\nday. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself\\r\\na bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife\\r\\nbeside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I could\\r\\nbut shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards\\r\\nmidnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,\\r\\nsomething cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’\\r\\n‘You fools!’ cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come\\r\\nand take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had said\\r\\nthat, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down\\r\\non each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery\\r\\neyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:\\r\\n‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ he replied, ‘but\\r\\njust show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’ said\\r\\nhe, ‘what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’\\r\\nThereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board\\r\\nand screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’ said he,\\r\\n‘and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he struck them dead and\\r\\nthrew them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,\\r\\nand was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and\\r\\ncorner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more\\r\\nand more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled\\r\\nhorribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put\\r\\nit out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were\\r\\ngoing too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you,\\r\\nvermin,’ and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others\\r\\nhe killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned\\r\\nthe embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his\\r\\neyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he\\r\\nlooked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing\\r\\nfor me,’ said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his\\r\\neyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over\\r\\nthe whole of the castle. ‘That’s right,’ said he, ‘but go faster.’ Then\\r\\nthe bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,\\r\\nover thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside\\r\\ndown, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up\\r\\nin the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and\\r\\nlay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king\\r\\ncame, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil\\r\\nspirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After all it is a\\r\\npity,--for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said: ‘It\\r\\nhas not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very glad,\\r\\nand asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one\\r\\nnight is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went to the\\r\\ninnkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to\\r\\nsee you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said he,\\r\\n‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\\r\\nfire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When\\r\\nmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at\\r\\nfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for\\r\\na while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the\\r\\nchimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’ cried he, ‘another half belongs\\r\\nto this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a\\r\\nroaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said\\r\\nhe, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had done\\r\\nthat and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a\\r\\nhideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’\\r\\nsaid the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push him away;\\r\\nthe youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all\\r\\nhis strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more\\r\\nmen fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men’s legs\\r\\nand two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The\\r\\nyouth also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’ ‘Yes,\\r\\nif you have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied he, ‘but your balls are\\r\\nnot quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and\\r\\nturned them till they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’\\r\\nsaid he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He played with them and lost some\\r\\nof his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his\\r\\nsight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came\\r\\nto inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’ asked he.\\r\\n‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’ he answered, ‘and have lost a couple\\r\\nof farthings.’ ‘Have you not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said he, ‘I have\\r\\nhad a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:\\r\\n‘If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and\\r\\nbrought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my little\\r\\ncousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his finger,\\r\\nand cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin on the\\r\\nground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay\\r\\ntherein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I\\r\\nwill warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his hand and\\r\\nlaid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him\\r\\nout, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his\\r\\narms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he\\r\\nthought to himself: ‘When two people lie in bed together, they warm each\\r\\nother,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by\\r\\nhim. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.\\r\\nThen said the youth, ‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’ The\\r\\ndead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘What!’ said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go\\r\\ninto your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut\\r\\nthe lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I cannot\\r\\nmanage to shudder,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as long as I\\r\\nlive.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.\\r\\nHe was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘You wretch,’ cried he,\\r\\n‘you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.’ ‘Not so\\r\\nfast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have to have a say\\r\\nin it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’ said the fiend. ‘Softly, softly, do not\\r\\ntalk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.’\\r\\n‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger, I will let you\\r\\ngo--come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to a smith’s\\r\\nforge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.\\r\\n‘I can do better than that,’ said the youth, and went to the other\\r\\nanvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his\\r\\nwhite beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil\\r\\nwith one blow, and in it caught the old man’s beard. ‘Now I have you,’\\r\\nsaid the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar\\r\\nand beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he\\r\\nwould give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.\\r\\nThe old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him\\r\\nthree chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’ said he, ‘one part is for the\\r\\npoor, the other for the king, the third yours.’ In the meantime it\\r\\nstruck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in\\r\\ndarkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt\\r\\nabout, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.\\r\\nNext morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must have learnt what\\r\\nshuddering is?’ ‘No,’ he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was\\r\\nhere, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down\\r\\nbelow, but no one told me what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said the\\r\\nking, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ‘That\\r\\nis all very well,’ said he, ‘but still I do not know what it is to\\r\\nshudder!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever\\r\\nmuch the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still\\r\\nsaid always: ‘If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.’ And this\\r\\nat last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will find a cure for him;\\r\\nhe shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to the stream\\r\\nwhich flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons\\r\\nbrought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was\\r\\nto draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water\\r\\nwith the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would\\r\\nsprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder\\r\\nso?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to\\r\\nshudder!’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKING GRISLY-BEARD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very\\r\\nbeautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the\\r\\nprinces who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she\\r\\nonly made sport of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all\\r\\nher suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their\\r\\nrank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,\\r\\nand knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she\\r\\nhad something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s\\r\\nas round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’\\r\\nsaid she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The\\r\\nfourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too\\r\\nred, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;\\r\\nso she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over\\r\\na baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but\\r\\nshe laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at\\r\\nhim,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called\\r\\nGrisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,\\r\\nand how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\\r\\nunwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that\\r\\ncame to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play\\r\\nunder the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,\\r\\n‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when\\r\\nhe had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the\\r\\nking said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for\\r\\nyour wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have\\r\\nsworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words\\r\\nand tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married\\r\\nto the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to\\r\\ngo--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\\r\\nto a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs\\r\\nto King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been\\r\\nthine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had\\r\\nmarried King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose\\r\\nare these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King\\r\\nGrisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!\\r\\nunlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King\\r\\nGrisly-beard!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.\\r\\n‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been\\r\\nthine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King\\r\\nGrisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why\\r\\nshould you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;\\r\\n‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,\\r\\n‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your\\r\\nservants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you\\r\\nmust do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put\\r\\non water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew\\r\\nnothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help\\r\\nher. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the\\r\\nfiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus\\r\\nthey lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the\\r\\ncottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and\\r\\nearning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and\\r\\ncut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made\\r\\nher fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and\\r\\nspin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to\\r\\nspin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See\\r\\nnow,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:\\r\\nwhat a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots\\r\\nand pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’\\r\\nsighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me\\r\\nstanding in the market, how they will laugh at me!’\\r\\n\\r\\nBut her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she\\r\\ndid not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many\\r\\npeople, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid\\r\\ntheir money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on\\r\\nthis as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of\\r\\nware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but\\r\\na drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,\\r\\nand broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,\\r\\nand knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what\\r\\nwill my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would\\r\\nhave thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an\\r\\nearthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?\\r\\nbut let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of\\r\\nwork, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not\\r\\nwant a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will\\r\\nhave plenty to eat.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all\\r\\nthe dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat\\r\\nthat was left, and on this they lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son\\r\\nwas passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows\\r\\nand looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of\\r\\nthe court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly\\r\\nwhich had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich\\r\\nmeats, which she put into her basket to take home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden\\r\\nclothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her\\r\\nby the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she\\r\\ntrembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was\\r\\nmaking sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the\\r\\ncover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then\\r\\neverybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she\\r\\nwished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the\\r\\ndoor to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and\\r\\nbrought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived\\r\\nwith you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I\\r\\nam also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only\\r\\nto cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your\\r\\nill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is\\r\\ntime to hold our marriage feast.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and\\r\\nher father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home\\r\\non her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was\\r\\ngrand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you\\r\\nand I had been of the party.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIRON HANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his\\r\\npalace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a\\r\\nhuntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. ‘Perhaps some\\r\\naccident has befallen him,’ said the king, and the next day he sent out\\r\\ntwo more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.\\r\\nThen on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ‘Scour\\r\\nthe whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all\\r\\nthree.’ But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.\\r\\nFrom that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,\\r\\nand it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen\\r\\nof it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for\\r\\nmany years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as\\r\\nseeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The\\r\\nking, however, would not give his consent, and said: ‘It is not safe in\\r\\nthere; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,\\r\\nand you would never come out again.’ The huntsman replied: ‘Lord, I will\\r\\nventure it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was\\r\\nnot long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to\\r\\npursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a\\r\\ndeep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of\\r\\nthe water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he\\r\\nwent back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the\\r\\nwater. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\\r\\nwas brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his\\r\\nknees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There\\r\\nwas great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put\\r\\nin an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened\\r\\non pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her\\r\\nkeeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the\\r\\nforest with safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the\\r\\ncourtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.\\r\\nThe boy ran thither and said: ‘Give me my ball out.’ ‘Not till you have\\r\\nopened the door for me,’ answered the man. ‘No,’ said the boy, ‘I will\\r\\nnot do that; the king has forbidden it,’ and ran away. The next day he\\r\\nagain went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: ‘Open my door,’\\r\\nbut the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,\\r\\nand the boy went once more and said: ‘I cannot open the door even if I\\r\\nwished, for I have not the key.’ Then the wild man said: ‘It lies under\\r\\nyour mother’s pillow, you can get it there.’ The boy, who wanted to have\\r\\nhis ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The\\r\\ndoor opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it\\r\\nwas open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried\\r\\naway. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: ‘Oh,\\r\\nwild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!’ The wild man turned\\r\\nback, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps\\r\\ninto the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,\\r\\nand asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,\\r\\nand sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one\\r\\nanswered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but\\r\\nthey did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and\\r\\nmuch grief reigned in the royal court.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy\\r\\ndown from his shoulder, and said to him: ‘You will never see your father\\r\\nand mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,\\r\\nand I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare\\r\\nwell. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\\r\\nworld.’ He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the\\r\\nnext morning the man took him to a well, and said: ‘Behold, the gold\\r\\nwell is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and\\r\\ntake care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will\\r\\ncome every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.’ The boy placed\\r\\nhimself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a\\r\\ngolden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.\\r\\nAs he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he\\r\\ninvoluntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw\\r\\nthat it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold\\r\\noff again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,\\r\\nlooked at the boy, and said: ‘What has happened to the well?’ ‘Nothing\\r\\nnothing,’ he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the\\r\\nman might not see it. But he said: ‘You have dipped your finger into\\r\\nthe water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let\\r\\nanything go in.’ By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and\\r\\nwatching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,\\r\\nand then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly\\r\\nout, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew\\r\\nwhat had happened. ‘You have let a hair fall into the well,’ said he.\\r\\n‘I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the\\r\\nthird time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with\\r\\nme.’\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\\r\\nhowever much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at\\r\\nthe reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he\\r\\nstill bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look\\r\\nstraight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into\\r\\nthe water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of\\r\\nhis head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how\\r\\nterrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it\\r\\nround his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he\\r\\nalready knew everything, and said: ‘Take the handkerchief off.’ Then the\\r\\ngolden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,\\r\\nit was of no use. ‘You have not stood the trial and can stay here no\\r\\nlonger. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.\\r\\nBut as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is\\r\\none thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the\\r\\nforest and cry: “Iron Hans,” and then I will come and help you. My\\r\\npower is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in\\r\\nabundance.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThen the king’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\\r\\npaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\\r\\nlooked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he\\r\\ncould help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they\\r\\nwould take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use\\r\\nthey could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At\\r\\nlength the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood\\r\\nand water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that\\r\\nno one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the\\r\\nroyal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he\\r\\nkept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under\\r\\nthe king’s notice, and he said: ‘When you come to the royal table you\\r\\nmust take your hat off.’ He answered: ‘Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad\\r\\nsore place on my head.’ Then the king had the cook called before him\\r\\nand scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his\\r\\nservice; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,\\r\\nhad pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener’s boy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear\\r\\nthe wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in\\r\\nthe garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air\\r\\nmight cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so\\r\\nthat the rays fell into the bedroom of the king’s daughter, and up she\\r\\nsprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to\\r\\nhim: ‘Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.’ He put his cap on with all\\r\\nhaste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he\\r\\nwas ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: ‘How\\r\\ncan you take the king’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go\\r\\nquickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.’ ‘Oh,\\r\\nno,’ replied the boy, ‘the wild ones have more scent, and will please\\r\\nher better.’ When he got into the room, the king’s daughter said: ‘Take\\r\\nyour cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.’ He again\\r\\nsaid: ‘I may not, I have a sore head.’ She, however, caught at his\\r\\ncap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his\\r\\nshoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she\\r\\nheld him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he\\r\\ndeparted, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the\\r\\ngardener, and said: ‘I present them to your children, they can play with\\r\\nthem.’ The following day the king’s daughter again called to him that he\\r\\nwas to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,\\r\\nshe instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,\\r\\nbut he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of\\r\\nducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for\\r\\nplaythings for his children. On the third day things went just the\\r\\nsame; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her\\r\\nmoney.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered\\r\\ntogether his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any\\r\\nopposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty\\r\\narmy. Then said the gardener’s boy: ‘I am grown up, and will go to the\\r\\nwars also, only give me a horse.’ The others laughed, and said: ‘Seek\\r\\none for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the\\r\\nstable for you.’ When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and\\r\\nled the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,\\r\\nhobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark\\r\\nforest. When he came to the outskirts, he called ‘Iron Hans’ three\\r\\ntimes so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man\\r\\nappeared immediately, and said: ‘What do you desire?’ ‘I want a strong\\r\\nsteed, for I am going to the wars.’ ‘That you shall have, and still more\\r\\nthan you ask for.’ Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it\\r\\nwas not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that\\r\\nsnorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind\\r\\nthem followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and\\r\\ntheir swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged\\r\\nhorse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the\\r\\nsoldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king’s\\r\\nmen had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give\\r\\nway. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like\\r\\na hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They\\r\\nbegan to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there\\r\\nwas not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he\\r\\nconducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron\\r\\nHans. ‘What do you desire?’ asked the wild man. ‘Take back your horse\\r\\nand your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.’ All that he\\r\\nasked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When\\r\\nthe king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and\\r\\nwished him joy of his victory. ‘I am not the one who carried away the\\r\\nvictory,’ said he, ‘but a strange knight who came to my assistance with\\r\\nhis soldiers.’ The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,\\r\\nbut the king did not know, and said: ‘He followed the enemy, and I did\\r\\nnot see him again.’ She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but\\r\\nhe smiled, and said: ‘He has just come home on his three-legged horse,\\r\\nand the others have been mocking him, and crying: “Here comes our\\r\\nhobblety jib back again!” They asked, too: “Under what hedge have you\\r\\nbeen lying sleeping all the time?” So he said: “I did the best of all,\\r\\nand it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was still more\\r\\nridiculed.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king said to his daughter: ‘I will proclaim a great feast that shall\\r\\nlast for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the\\r\\nunknown man will show himself.’ When the feast was announced, the youth\\r\\nwent out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. ‘What do you desire?’\\r\\nasked he. ‘That I may catch the king’s daughter’s golden apple.’ ‘It is\\r\\nas safe as if you had it already,’ said Iron Hans. ‘You shall likewise\\r\\nhave a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited\\r\\nchestnut-horse.’ When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took\\r\\nhis place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king’s\\r\\ndaughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none\\r\\nof them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him\\r\\na white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and\\r\\nhe did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew\\r\\nangry, and said: ‘That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell\\r\\nhis name.’ He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,\\r\\nshould go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come\\r\\nback willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and\\r\\na black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off\\r\\nwith it, the king’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near\\r\\nhim that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword. The\\r\\nyouth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently\\r\\nthat the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they could see that he\\r\\nhad golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following day the king’s daughter asked the gardener about his\\r\\nboy. ‘He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the\\r\\nfestival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise\\r\\nshown my children three golden apples which he has won.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had\\r\\nhis little cap on his head. But the king’s daughter went up to him and\\r\\ntook it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and\\r\\nhe was so handsome that all were amazed. ‘Are you the knight who came\\r\\nevery day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught\\r\\nthe three golden apples?’ asked the king. ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘and here\\r\\nthe apples are,’ and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them\\r\\nto the king. ‘If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which\\r\\nyour people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight\\r\\nwho helped you to your victory over your enemies.’ ‘If you can perform\\r\\nsuch deeds as that, you are no gardener’s boy; tell me, who is your\\r\\nfather?’ ‘My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great\\r\\nas I require.’ ‘I well see,’ said the king, ‘that I owe my thanks to\\r\\nyou; can I do anything to please you?’ ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘that indeed\\r\\nyou can. Give me your daughter to wife.’ The maiden laughed, and said:\\r\\n‘He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his\\r\\ngolden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,’ and then she went and\\r\\nkissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great\\r\\ndelight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear\\r\\nson again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music\\r\\nsuddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a\\r\\ngreat retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: ‘I am\\r\\nIron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free;\\r\\nall the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.’\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCAT-SKIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was\\r\\nso beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of\\r\\nthe earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her\\r\\nend drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you\\r\\nwill never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful\\r\\nas I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’ Then when the king in his\\r\\ngrief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king\\r\\nwas not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking\\r\\nanother wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do;\\r\\nthe king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were\\r\\nsent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.\\r\\nBut there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had\\r\\nbeen, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the\\r\\nmessengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,\\r\\nand had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked\\r\\nat her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to\\r\\nhis courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my\\r\\ndead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole\\r\\nearth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this\\r\\nthey were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry\\r\\nhis daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter\\r\\nwas also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;\\r\\nso she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:\\r\\none must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,\\r\\nlike the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,\\r\\nI want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to\\r\\nwhich every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus\\r\\nshe thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the\\r\\nmost skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,\\r\\nlike the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,\\r\\nlike the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in\\r\\nhis kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a\\r\\nmantle of a thousand furs was made.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\\r\\nnight when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden\\r\\nring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three\\r\\ndresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and\\r\\nwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared\\r\\nher face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for\\r\\nhelp in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till\\r\\nat last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself\\r\\ndown in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept\\r\\non till it was midday.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs\\r\\ncame to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and\\r\\nbark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort\\r\\nof game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they\\r\\ncame back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful\\r\\nbeast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand\\r\\nkinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if\\r\\nyou can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen\\r\\ntook it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,\\r\\n‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on\\r\\nme and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will\\r\\ndo for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that\\r\\nsort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s\\r\\npalace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where\\r\\nno light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and\\r\\nsleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood\\r\\nand water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the\\r\\nashes, and do all the dirty work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty\\r\\nprincess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened\\r\\none day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to\\r\\nthe cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will\\r\\ntake care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may\\r\\ngo, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’\\r\\nThen she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the\\r\\nfur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her\\r\\nbeauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened\\r\\nher nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,\\r\\nand so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew\\r\\nher, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But\\r\\nthe king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and\\r\\nhe thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked\\r\\nround for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood\\r\\nat the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth\\r\\nwas, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,\\r\\nblackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was\\r\\nCat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began\\r\\nto rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and\\r\\nheat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but\\r\\ntake care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of\\r\\nnever eating again.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and\\r\\ntoasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it\\r\\nwas ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,\\r\\nand put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,\\r\\nthe king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,\\r\\nthat he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom\\r\\nhe saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got\\r\\nthere, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when\\r\\nhe heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall\\r\\ninto the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went\\r\\nbefore the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’\\r\\nanswered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better\\r\\ndone than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did\\r\\nnot cook it, but Cat-skin did.’ ‘Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the\\r\\nking: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor\\r\\nchild,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you\\r\\nin my palace?’ asked he. ‘I am good for nothing,’ said she, ‘but to be\\r\\nscullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ‘But how\\r\\ndid you get the ring that was in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she\\r\\nwould not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent\\r\\nher away again about her business.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let\\r\\nher go up and see it as before. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘but come again in half\\r\\nan hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then she\\r\\nran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress\\r\\nout which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,\\r\\nlooking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at\\r\\nseeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the\\r\\ndance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did\\r\\nnot see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and\\r\\nmade herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the\\r\\nsoup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and\\r\\ndropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,\\r\\nand it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who\\r\\nwas again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was\\r\\nbrought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only\\r\\nfit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third\\r\\ntime, it happened just the same as before. ‘You must be a witch,\\r\\nCat-skin,’ said the cook; ‘for you always put something into your soup,\\r\\nso that it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up\\r\\nas before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and\\r\\nwent into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and\\r\\nthought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst\\r\\nhe was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her\\r\\nseeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.\\r\\nWhen it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she\\r\\nslipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight\\r\\nof her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under\\r\\nthe stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the\\r\\nhalf-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her\\r\\nfur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over\\r\\nwith soot, but left one of her fingers white.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon\\r\\nas the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the\\r\\nking got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and\\r\\nsoon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst\\r\\nthey were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and\\r\\nwhen she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off\\r\\na little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\\r\\nbeautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\\r\\nwashed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the\\r\\nmost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,\\r\\n‘You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each\\r\\nother.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever\\r\\nwas heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of\\r\\nthe cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore\\r\\nwhite and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the\\r\\ntwo rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.\\r\\nThey were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children\\r\\nin the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than\\r\\nRose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields\\r\\nseeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home\\r\\nwith her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when\\r\\nthere was nothing to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two children were so fond of one another that they always held each\\r\\nother by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:\\r\\n‘We will not leave each other,’ Rose-red answered: ‘Never so long as we\\r\\nlive,’ and their mother would add: ‘What one has she must share with the\\r\\nother.’\\r\\n\\r\\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no\\r\\nbeasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little\\r\\nhare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by\\r\\ntheir side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon\\r\\nthe boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and\\r\\nnight came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,\\r\\nand slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not\\r\\nworry on their account.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused\\r\\nthem, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near\\r\\ntheir bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing\\r\\nand went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that\\r\\nthey had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly\\r\\nhave fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces\\r\\nfurther. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who\\r\\nwatches over good children.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that\\r\\nit was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care\\r\\nof the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s\\r\\nbed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter\\r\\nSnow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle\\r\\nwas of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the\\r\\nevening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: ‘Go, Snow-white, and\\r\\nbolt the door,’ and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took\\r\\nher spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls\\r\\nlistened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the\\r\\nfloor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head\\r\\nhidden beneath its wings.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone\\r\\nknocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:\\r\\n‘Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking\\r\\nshelter.’ Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a\\r\\npoor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black\\r\\nhead within the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,\\r\\nand Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began\\r\\nto speak and said: ‘Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am\\r\\nhalf-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n‘Poor bear,’ said the mother, ‘lie down by the fire, only take care that\\r\\nyou do not burn your coat.’ Then she cried: ‘Snow-white, Rose-red, come\\r\\nout, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.’ So they both came\\r\\nout, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid\\r\\nof him. The bear said: ‘Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a\\r\\nlittle’; so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean;\\r\\nand he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and\\r\\ncomfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played\\r\\ntricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,\\r\\nput their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a\\r\\nhazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the\\r\\nbear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called\\r\\nout: ‘Leave me alive, children,\\r\\n\\r\\n  Snow-white, Rose-red,\\r\\n  Will you beat your wooer dead?’\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the\\r\\nbear: ‘You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from\\r\\nthe cold and the bad weather.’ As soon as day dawned the two children\\r\\nlet him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\\r\\n\\r\\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself\\r\\ndown by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as\\r\\nmuch as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were\\r\\nnever fastened until their black friend had arrived.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one\\r\\nmorning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the\\r\\nwhole summer.’ ‘Where are you going, then, dear bear?’ asked Snow-white.\\r\\n‘I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked\\r\\ndwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged\\r\\nto stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun\\r\\nhas thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to\\r\\npry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves,\\r\\ndoes not easily see daylight again.’\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the\\r\\ndoor for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt\\r\\nand a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white\\r\\nas if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about\\r\\nit. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the\\r\\ntrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest\\r\\nto get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the\\r\\nground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and\\r\\nforwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When\\r\\nthey came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a\\r\\nsnow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a\\r\\ncrevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog\\r\\ntied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: ‘Why do you\\r\\nstand there? Can you not come here and help me?’ ‘What are you up to,\\r\\nlittle man?’ asked Rose-red. ‘You stupid, prying goose!’ answered the\\r\\ndwarf: ‘I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.\\r\\nThe little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with\\r\\nheavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had\\r\\njust driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;\\r\\nbut the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the\\r\\ntree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white\\r\\nbeard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek,\\r\\nmilk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!’\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it\\r\\nwas caught too fast. ‘I will run and fetch someone,’ said Rose-red. ‘You\\r\\nsenseless goose!’ snarled the dwarf; ‘why should you fetch someone? You\\r\\nare already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?’\\r\\n‘Don’t be impatient,’ said Snow-white, ‘I will help you,’ and she pulled\\r\\nher scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay\\r\\namongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it\\r\\nup, grumbling to himself: ‘Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine\\r\\nbeard. Bad luck to you!’ and then he swung the bag upon his back, and\\r\\nwent off without even once looking at the children.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish\\r\\nof fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large\\r\\ngrasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.\\r\\nThey ran to it and found it was the dwarf. ‘Where are you going?’ said\\r\\nRose-red; ‘you surely don’t want to go into the water?’ ‘I am not such\\r\\na fool!’ cried the dwarf; ‘don’t you see that the accursed fish wants\\r\\nto pull me in?’ The little man had been sitting there fishing, and\\r\\nunluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a\\r\\nmoment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not\\r\\nstrength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the\\r\\ndwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of\\r\\nlittle good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and\\r\\nwas in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his\\r\\nbeard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast\\r\\ntogether. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut\\r\\nthe beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that\\r\\nhe screamed out: ‘Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man’s\\r\\nface? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have\\r\\ncut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.\\r\\nI wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!’ Then he took\\r\\nout a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word\\r\\nhe dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the\\r\\ntown to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them\\r\\nacross a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There\\r\\nthey noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and\\r\\nround above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a\\r\\nrock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran\\r\\nup and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance\\r\\nthe dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,\\r\\nand pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.\\r\\nAs soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried\\r\\nwith his shrill voice: ‘Could you not have done it more carefully! You\\r\\ndragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you\\r\\nclumsy creatures!’ Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and\\r\\nslipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by\\r\\nthis time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their\\r\\nbusiness in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\\r\\ndwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,\\r\\nand had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening\\r\\nsun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with\\r\\nall colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared\\r\\nat them. ‘Why do you stand gaping there?’ cried the dwarf, and his\\r\\nashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a\\r\\nloud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out\\r\\nof the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach\\r\\nhis cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart\\r\\nhe cried: ‘Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;\\r\\nlook, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you\\r\\nwant with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me\\r\\nbetween your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender\\r\\nmorsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat them!’ The\\r\\nbear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single\\r\\nblow with his paw, and he did not move again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them: ‘Snow-white and\\r\\nRose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.’ Then they\\r\\nrecognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly\\r\\nhis bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in\\r\\ngold. ‘I am a king’s son,’ he said, ‘and I was bewitched by that wicked\\r\\ndwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest\\r\\nas a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his\\r\\nwell-deserved punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nSnow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they\\r\\ndivided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered\\r\\ntogether in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with\\r\\nher children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and\\r\\nthey stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful\\r\\nroses, white and red.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",
       " '**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born\\r\\nin Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout\\r\\ntheir lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg\\r\\nUniversity. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology,\\r\\nand although Wilhelm’s work was hampered by poor health the brothers\\r\\ncollaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until\\r\\na century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known\\r\\nfor the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral\\r\\nsources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in\\r\\n1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as\\r\\npart of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was\\r\\nfirst published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon\\r\\ncame into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar\\r\\nTaylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about\\r\\nfifty stories ‘with the amusement of some young friends principally in\\r\\nview.’ They have been an essential ingredient of children’s reading ever\\r\\nsince.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\\r\\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\\r\\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\\r\\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n']"

I lived there two\\r\\nyears and two months. At present I am a sojourner in civilized life\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if\\r\\nvery particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning\\r\\nmy mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not\\r\\nappear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances,\\r\\nvery natural and pertinent. Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did\\r\\nnot feel lonesome; if I was not afraid; and the like. Others have been\\r\\ncurious to learn what portion of my income I devoted to charitable\\r\\npurposes; and some, who have large families, how many poor children I\\r\\nmaintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no\\r\\nparticular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of\\r\\nthese questions in this book. In most books, the _I_, or first person,\\r\\nis omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism,\\r\\nis the main difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after\\r\\nall, always the first person that is speaking. I should not talk so\\r\\nmuch about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well.\\r\\nUnfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my\\r\\nexperience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or\\r\\nlast, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what\\r\\nhe has heard of other men’s lives; some such account as he would send\\r\\nto his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it\\r\\nmust have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more\\r\\nparticularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers,\\r\\nthey will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will\\r\\nstretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to\\r\\nhim whom it fits.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and\\r\\nSandwich Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in\\r\\nNew England; something about your condition, especially your outward\\r\\ncondition or circumstances in this world, in this town, what it is,\\r\\nwhether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is, whether it cannot\\r\\nbe improved as well as not. I have travelled a good deal in Concord;\\r\\nand everywhere, in shops, and offices, and fields, the inhabitants have\\r\\nappeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways. What\\r\\nI have heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in\\r\\nthe face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their heads downward,\\r\\nover flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders “until it\\r\\nbecomes impossible for them to resume their natural position, while\\r\\nfrom the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the\\r\\nstomach;” or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or\\r\\nmeasuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast\\r\\nempires; or standing on one leg on the tops of pillars,—even these\\r\\nforms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing\\r\\nthan the scenes which I daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules\\r\\nwere trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have\\r\\nundertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an end; but I could\\r\\nnever see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any\\r\\nlabor. They have no friend Iolas to burn with a hot iron the root of\\r\\nthe hydra’s head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.\\r\\n\\r\\nI see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited\\r\\nfarms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more\\r\\neasily acquired than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the\\r\\nopen pasture and suckled by a wolf, that they might have seen with\\r\\nclearer eyes what field they were called to labor in. Who made them\\r\\nserfs of the soil? Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is\\r\\ncondemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging\\r\\ntheir graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live a man’s\\r\\nlife, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as they\\r\\ncan. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well nigh crushed and\\r\\nsmothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing\\r\\nbefore it a barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never\\r\\ncleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and\\r\\nwood-lot! The portionless, who struggle with no such unnecessary\\r\\ninherited encumbrances, find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a\\r\\nfew cubic feet of flesh.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon\\r\\nplowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called\\r\\nnecessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up\\r\\ntreasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through\\r\\nand steal. It is a fool’s life, as they will find when they get to the\\r\\nend of it, if not before. It is said that Deucalion and Pyrrha created\\r\\nmen by throwing stones over their heads behind them:—\\r\\n\\r\\n     Inde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,\\r\\n     Et documenta damus quâ simus origine nati.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way,—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,\\r\\n     Approving that our bodies of a stony nature are.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle, throwing the\\r\\nstones over their heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere\\r\\nignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and\\r\\nsuperfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be\\r\\nplucked by them. Their fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy and\\r\\ntremble too much for that. Actually, the laboring man has not leisure\\r\\nfor a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the\\r\\nmanliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the\\r\\nmarket. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he\\r\\nremember well his ignorance—which his growth requires—who has so often\\r\\nto use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously\\r\\nsometimes, and recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him.\\r\\nThe finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be\\r\\npreserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat\\r\\nourselves nor one another thus tenderly.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to live, are\\r\\nsometimes, as it were, gasping for breath. I have no doubt that some of\\r\\nyou who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you\\r\\nhave actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing\\r\\nor are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed\\r\\nor stolen time, robbing your creditors of an hour. It is very evident\\r\\nwhat mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been\\r\\nwhetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into\\r\\nbusiness and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called\\r\\nby the Latins _æs alienum_, another’s brass, for some of their coins\\r\\nwere made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other’s\\r\\nbrass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying\\r\\ntoday, insolvent; seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many\\r\\nmodes, only not state-prison offences; lying, flattering, voting,\\r\\ncontracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an\\r\\natmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade your\\r\\nneighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his coat, or his\\r\\ncarriage, or import his groceries for him; making yourselves sick, that\\r\\nyou may lay up something against a sick day, something to be tucked\\r\\naway in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or, more\\r\\nsafely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter how much or how\\r\\nlittle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to\\r\\nattend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called Negro\\r\\nSlavery, there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both\\r\\nnorth and south. It is hard to have a southern overseer; it is worse to\\r\\nhave a northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of\\r\\nyourself. Talk of a divinity in man! Look at the teamster on the\\r\\nhighway, wending to market by day or night; does any divinity stir\\r\\nwithin him? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses! What is\\r\\nhis destiny to him compared with the shipping interests? Does not he\\r\\ndrive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how immortal, is he? See how\\r\\nhe cowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not being\\r\\nimmortal nor divine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of\\r\\nhimself, a fame won by his own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant\\r\\ncompared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself,\\r\\nthat it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate.\\r\\nSelf-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the fancy and\\r\\nimagination,—what Wilberforce is there to bring that about? Think,\\r\\nalso, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the\\r\\nlast day, not to betray too green an interest in their fates! As if you\\r\\ncould kill time without injuring eternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called\\r\\nresignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go\\r\\ninto the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the\\r\\nbravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is\\r\\nconcealed even under what are called the games and amusements of\\r\\nmankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is\\r\\na characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief\\r\\nend of man, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it\\r\\nappears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living\\r\\nbecause they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there\\r\\nis no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun\\r\\nrose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of\\r\\nthinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What\\r\\neverybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to\\r\\nbe falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted\\r\\nfor a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What\\r\\nold people say you cannot do you try and find that you can. Old deeds\\r\\nfor old people, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough\\r\\nonce, perchance, to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going; new\\r\\npeople put a little dry wood under a pot, and are whirled round the\\r\\nglobe with the speed of birds, in a way to kill old people, as the\\r\\nphrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an\\r\\ninstructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost.\\r\\nOne may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned any thing of\\r\\nabsolute value by living. Practically, the old have no very important\\r\\nadvice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and\\r\\ntheir lives have been such miserable failures, for private reasons, as\\r\\nthey must believe; and it may be that they have some faith left which\\r\\nbelies that experience, and they are only less young than they were. I\\r\\nhave lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the\\r\\nfirst syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They\\r\\nhave told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me any thing to the\\r\\npurpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me;\\r\\nbut it does not avail me that they have tried it. If I have any\\r\\nexperience which I think valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my\\r\\nMentors said nothing about.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne farmer says to me, “You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for\\r\\nit furnishes nothing to make bones with;” and so he religiously devotes\\r\\na part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of\\r\\nbones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with\\r\\nvegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plough along in spite\\r\\nof every obstacle. Some things are really necessaries of life in some\\r\\ncircles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries\\r\\nmerely, and in others still are entirely unknown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by\\r\\ntheir predecessors, both the heights and the valleys, and all things to\\r\\nhave been cared for. According to Evelyn, “the wise Solomon prescribed\\r\\nordinances for the very distances of trees; and the Roman prætors have\\r\\ndecided how often you may go into your neighbor’s land to gather the\\r\\nacorns which fall on it without trespass, and what share belongs to\\r\\nthat neighbor.” Hippocrates has even left directions how we should cut\\r\\nour nails; that is, even with the ends of the fingers, neither shorter\\r\\nnor longer. Undoubtedly the very tedium and ennui which presume to have\\r\\nexhausted the variety and the joys of life are as old as Adam. But\\r\\nman’s capacities have never been measured; nor are we to judge of what\\r\\nhe can do by any precedents, so little has been tried. Whatever have\\r\\nbeen thy failures hitherto, “be not afflicted, my child, for who shall\\r\\nassign to thee what thou hast left undone?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe might try our lives by a thousand simple tests; as, for instance,\\r\\nthat the same sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of\\r\\nearths like ours. If I had remembered this it would have prevented some\\r\\nmistakes. This was not the light in which I hoed them. The stars are\\r\\nthe apexes of what wonderful triangles! What distant and different\\r\\nbeings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating the\\r\\nsame one at the same moment! Nature and human life are as various as\\r\\nour several constitutions. Who shall say what prospect life offers to\\r\\nanother? Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through\\r\\neach other’s eyes for an instant? We should live in all the ages of the\\r\\nworld in an hour; ay, in all the worlds of the ages. History, Poetry,\\r\\nMythology!—I know of no reading of another’s experience so startling\\r\\nand informing as this would be.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe greater part of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to\\r\\nbe bad, and if I repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good\\r\\nbehavior. What demon possessed me that I behaved so well? You may say\\r\\nthe wisest thing you can, old man,—you who have lived seventy years,\\r\\nnot without honor of a kind,—I hear an irresistible voice which invites\\r\\nme away from all that. One generation abandons the enterprises of\\r\\nanother like stranded vessels.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do. We may\\r\\nwaive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere.\\r\\nNature is as well adapted to our weakness as to our strength. The\\r\\nincessant anxiety and strain of some is a well nigh incurable form of\\r\\ndisease. We are made to exaggerate the importance of what work we do;\\r\\nand yet how much is not done by us! or, what if we had been taken sick?\\r\\nHow vigilant we are! determined not to live by faith if we can avoid\\r\\nit; all the day long on the alert, at night we unwillingly say our\\r\\nprayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties. So thoroughly and\\r\\nsincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying\\r\\nthe possibility of change. This is the only way, we say; but there are\\r\\nas many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre. All change is\\r\\na miracle to contemplate; but it is a miracle which is taking place\\r\\nevery instant. Confucius said, “To know that we know what we know, and\\r\\nthat we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.” When\\r\\none man has reduced a fact of the imagination to be a fact to his\\r\\nunderstanding, I foresee that all men at length establish their lives\\r\\non that basis.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which\\r\\nI have referred to is about, and how much it is necessary that we be\\r\\ntroubled, or, at least, careful. It would be some advantage to live a\\r\\nprimitive and frontier life, though in the midst of an outward\\r\\ncivilization, if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of life\\r\\nand what methods have been taken to obtain them; or even to look over\\r\\nthe old day-books of the merchants, to see what it was that men most\\r\\ncommonly bought at the stores, what they stored, that is, what are the\\r\\ngrossest groceries. For the improvements of ages have had but little\\r\\ninfluence on the essential laws of man’s existence; as our skeletons,\\r\\nprobably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the words, _necessary of life_, I mean whatever, of all that man\\r\\nobtains by his own exertions, has been from the first, or from long use\\r\\nhas become, so important to human life that few, if any, whether from\\r\\nsavageness, or poverty, or philosophy, ever attempt to do without it.\\r\\nTo many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of life,\\r\\nFood. To the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of palatable\\r\\ngrass, with water to drink; unless he seeks the Shelter of the forest\\r\\nor the mountain’s shadow. None of the brute creation requires more than\\r\\nFood and Shelter. The necessaries of life for man in this climate may,\\r\\naccurately enough, be distributed under the several heads of Food,\\r\\nShelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these are we\\r\\nprepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a\\r\\nprospect of success. Man has invented, not only houses, but clothes and\\r\\ncooked food; and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth\\r\\nof fire, and the consequent use of it, at first a luxury, arose the\\r\\npresent necessity to sit by it. We observe cats and dogs acquiring the\\r\\nsame second nature. By proper Shelter and Clothing we legitimately\\r\\nretain our own internal heat; but with an excess of these, or of Fuel,\\r\\nthat is, with an external heat greater than our own internal, may not\\r\\ncookery properly be said to begin? Darwin, the naturalist, says of the\\r\\ninhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, that while his own party, who were\\r\\nwell clothed and sitting close to a fire, were far from too warm, these\\r\\nnaked savages, who were farther off, were observed, to his great\\r\\nsurprise, “to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a\\r\\nroasting.” So, we are told, the New Hollander goes naked with impunity,\\r\\nwhile the European shivers in his clothes. Is it impossible to combine\\r\\nthe hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the\\r\\ncivilized man? According to Liebig, man’s body is a stove, and food the\\r\\nfuel which keeps up the internal combustion in the lungs. In cold\\r\\nweather we eat more, in warm less. The animal heat is the result of a\\r\\nslow combustion, and disease and death take place when this is too\\r\\nrapid; or for want of fuel, or from some defect in the draught, the\\r\\nfire goes out. Of course the vital heat is not to be confounded with\\r\\nfire; but so much for analogy. It appears, therefore, from the above\\r\\nlist, that the expression, _animal life_, is nearly synonymous with the\\r\\nexpression, _animal heat_; for while Food may be regarded as the Fuel\\r\\nwhich keeps up the fire within us,—and Fuel serves only to prepare that\\r\\nFood or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition from\\r\\nwithout,—Shelter and Clothing also serve only to retain the _heat_ thus\\r\\ngenerated and absorbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep the\\r\\nvital heat in us. What pains we accordingly take, not only with our\\r\\nFood, and Clothing, and Shelter, but with our beds, which are our\\r\\nnight-clothes, robbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this\\r\\nshelter within a shelter, as the mole has its bed of grass and leaves\\r\\nat the end of its burrow! The poor man is wont to complain that this is\\r\\na cold world; and to cold, no less physical than social, we refer\\r\\ndirectly a great part of our ails. The summer, in some climates, makes\\r\\npossible to man a sort of Elysian life. Fuel, except to cook his Food,\\r\\nis then unnecessary; the sun is his fire, and many of the fruits are\\r\\nsufficiently cooked by its rays; while Food generally is more various,\\r\\nand more easily obtained, and Clothing and Shelter are wholly or half\\r\\nunnecessary. At the present day, and in this country, as I find by my\\r\\nown experience, a few implements, a knife, an axe, a spade, a\\r\\nwheelbarrow, &c., and for the studious, lamplight, stationery, and\\r\\naccess to a few books, rank next to necessaries, and can all be\\r\\nobtained at a trifling cost. Yet some, not wise, go to the other side\\r\\nof the globe, to barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote themselves\\r\\nto trade for ten or twenty years, in order that they may live,—that is,\\r\\nkeep comfortably warm,—and die in New England at last. The luxuriously\\r\\nrich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot; as I\\r\\nimplied before, they are cooked, of course _à la mode_.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are\\r\\nnot only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of\\r\\nmankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever\\r\\nlived a more simple and meagre life than the poor. The ancient\\r\\nphilosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek, were a class than\\r\\nwhich none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich in inward.\\r\\nWe know not much about them. It is remarkable that _we_ know so much of\\r\\nthem as we do. The same is true of the more modern reformers and\\r\\nbenefactors of their race. None can be an impartial or wise observer of\\r\\nhuman life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary\\r\\npoverty. Of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in\\r\\nagriculture, or commerce, or literature, or art. There are nowadays\\r\\nprofessors of philosophy, but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to\\r\\nprofess because it was once admirable to live. To be a philosopher is\\r\\nnot merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so\\r\\nto love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of\\r\\nsimplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some\\r\\nof the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. The\\r\\nsuccess of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like\\r\\nsuccess, not kingly, not manly. They make shift to live merely by\\r\\nconformity, practically as their fathers did, and are in no sense the\\r\\nprogenitors of a nobler race of men. But why do men degenerate ever?\\r\\nWhat makes families run out? What is the nature of the luxury which\\r\\nenervates and destroys nations? Are we sure that there is none of it in\\r\\nour own lives? The philosopher is in advance of his age even in the\\r\\noutward form of his life. He is not fed, sheltered, clothed, warmed,\\r\\nlike his contemporaries. How can a man be a philosopher and not\\r\\nmaintain his vital heat by better methods than other men?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a man is warmed by the several modes which I have described, what\\r\\ndoes he want next? Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and\\r\\nricher food, larger and more splendid houses, finer and more abundant\\r\\nclothing, more numerous incessant and hotter fires, and the like. When\\r\\nhe has obtained those things which are necessary to life, there is\\r\\nanother alternative than to obtain the superfluities; and that is, to\\r\\nadventure on life now, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced.\\r\\nThe soil, it appears, is suited to the seed, for it has sent its\\r\\nradicle downward, and it may now send its shoot upward also with\\r\\nconfidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but\\r\\nthat he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above?—for the\\r\\nnobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and\\r\\nlight, far from the ground, and are not treated like the humbler\\r\\nesculents, which, though they may be biennials, are cultivated only\\r\\ntill they have perfected their root, and often cut down at top for this\\r\\npurpose, so that most would not know them in their flowering season.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures, who\\r\\nwill mind their own affairs whether in heaven or hell, and perchance\\r\\nbuild more magnificently and spend more lavishly than the richest,\\r\\nwithout ever impoverishing themselves, not knowing how they live,—if,\\r\\nindeed, there are any such, as has been dreamed; nor to those who find\\r\\ntheir encouragement and inspiration in precisely the present condition\\r\\nof things, and cherish it with the fondness and enthusiasm of\\r\\nlovers,—and, to some extent, I reckon myself in this number; I do not\\r\\nspeak to those who are well employed, in whatever circumstances, and\\r\\nthey know whether they are well employed or not;—but mainly to the mass\\r\\nof men who are discontented, and idly complaining of the hardness of\\r\\ntheir lot or of the times, when they might improve them. There are some\\r\\nwho complain most energetically and inconsolably of any, because they\\r\\nare, as they say, doing their duty. I also have in my mind that\\r\\nseemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who\\r\\nhave accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it,\\r\\nand thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I should attempt to tell how I have desired to spend my life in\\r\\nyears past, it would probably surprise those of my readers who are\\r\\nsomewhat acquainted with its actual history; it would certainly\\r\\nastonish those who know nothing about it. I will only hint at some of\\r\\nthe enterprises which I have cherished.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to\\r\\nimprove the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the\\r\\nmeeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the\\r\\npresent moment; to toe that line. You will pardon some obscurities, for\\r\\nthere are more secrets in my trade than in most men’s, and yet not\\r\\nvoluntarily kept, but inseparable from its very nature. I would gladly\\r\\ntell all that I know about it, and never paint “No Admittance” on my\\r\\ngate.\\r\\n\\r\\nI long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still\\r\\non their trail. Many are the travellers I have spoken concerning them,\\r\\ndescribing their tracks and what calls they answered to. I have met one\\r\\nor two who had heard the hound, and the tramp of the horse, and even\\r\\nseen the dove disappear behind a cloud, and they seemed as anxious to\\r\\nrecover them as if they had lost them themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo anticipate, not the sunrise and the dawn merely, but, if possible,\\r\\nNature herself! How many mornings, summer and winter, before yet any\\r\\nneighbor was stirring about his business, have I been about mine! No\\r\\ndoubt, many of my townsmen have met me returning from this enterprise,\\r\\nfarmers starting for Boston in the twilight, or woodchoppers going to\\r\\ntheir work. It is true, I never assisted the sun materially in his\\r\\nrising, but, doubt not, it was of the last importance only to be\\r\\npresent at it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo many autumn, ay, and winter days, spent outside the town, trying to\\r\\nhear what was in the wind, to hear and carry it express! I well-nigh\\r\\nsunk all my capital in it, and lost my own breath into the bargain,\\r\\nrunning in the face of it. If it had concerned either of the political\\r\\nparties, depend upon it, it would have appeared in the Gazette with the\\r\\nearliest intelligence. At other times watching from the observatory of\\r\\nsome cliff or tree, to telegraph any new arrival; or waiting at evening\\r\\non the hill-tops for the sky to fall, that I might catch something,\\r\\nthough I never caught much, and that, manna-wise, would dissolve again\\r\\nin the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a long time I was reporter to a journal, of no very wide\\r\\ncirculation, whose editor has never yet seen fit to print the bulk of\\r\\nmy contributions, and, as is too common with writers, I got only my\\r\\nlabor for my pains. However, in this case my pains were their own\\r\\nreward.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years I was self-appointed inspector of snow storms and rain\\r\\nstorms, and did my duty faithfully; surveyor, if not of highways, then\\r\\nof forest paths and all across-lot routes, keeping them open, and\\r\\nravines bridged and passable at all seasons, where the public heel had\\r\\ntestified to their utility.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have looked after the wild stock of the town, which give a faithful\\r\\nherdsman a good deal of trouble by leaping fences; and I have had an\\r\\neye to the unfrequented nooks and corners of the farm; though I did not\\r\\nalways know whether Jonas or Solomon worked in a particular field\\r\\nto-day; that was none of my business. I have watered the red\\r\\nhuckleberry, the sand cherry and the nettle tree, the red pine and the\\r\\nblack ash, the white grape and the yellow violet, which might have\\r\\nwithered else in dry seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, I went on thus for a long time, I may say it without\\r\\nboasting, faithfully minding my business, till it became more and more\\r\\nevident that my townsmen would not after all admit me into the list of\\r\\ntown officers, nor make my place a sinecure with a moderate allowance.\\r\\nMy accounts, which I can swear to have kept faithfully, I have, indeed,\\r\\nnever got audited, still less accepted, still less paid and settled.\\r\\nHowever, I have not set my heart on that.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets at the house of\\r\\na well-known lawyer in my neighborhood. “Do you wish to buy any\\r\\nbaskets?” he asked. “No, we do not want any,” was the reply. “What!”\\r\\nexclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, “do you mean to starve\\r\\nus?” Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well off,—that the\\r\\nlawyer had only to weave arguments, and by some magic, wealth and\\r\\nstanding followed, he had said to himself; I will go into business; I\\r\\nwill weave baskets; it is a thing which I can do. Thinking that when he\\r\\nhad made the baskets he would have done his part, and then it would be\\r\\nthe white man’s to buy them. He had not discovered that it was\\r\\nnecessary for him to make it worth the other’s while to buy them, or at\\r\\nleast make him think that it was so, or to make something else which it\\r\\nwould be worth his while to buy. I too had woven a kind of basket of a\\r\\ndelicate texture, but I had not made it worth any one’s while to buy\\r\\nthem. Yet not the less, in my case, did I think it worth my while to\\r\\nweave them, and instead of studying how to make it worth men’s while to\\r\\nbuy my baskets, I studied rather how to avoid the necessity of selling\\r\\nthem. The life which men praise and regard as successful is but one\\r\\nkind. Why should we exaggerate any one kind at the expense of the\\r\\nothers?\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding that my fellow-citizens were not likely to offer me any room in\\r\\nthe court house, or any curacy or living any where else, but I must\\r\\nshift for myself, I turned my face more exclusively than ever to the\\r\\nwoods, where I was better known. I determined to go into business at\\r\\nonce, and not wait to acquire the usual capital, using such slender\\r\\nmeans as I had already got. My purpose in going to Walden Pond was not\\r\\nto live cheaply nor to live dearly there, but to transact some private\\r\\nbusiness with the fewest obstacles; to be hindered from accomplishing\\r\\nwhich for want of a little common sense, a little enterprise and\\r\\nbusiness talent, appeared not so sad as foolish.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have always endeavored to acquire strict business habits; they are\\r\\nindispensable to every man. If your trade is with the Celestial Empire,\\r\\nthen some small counting house on the coast, in some Salem harbor, will\\r\\nbe fixture enough. You will export such articles as the country\\r\\naffords, purely native products, much ice and pine timber and a little\\r\\ngranite, always in native bottoms. These will be good ventures. To\\r\\noversee all the details yourself in person; to be at once pilot and\\r\\ncaptain, and owner and underwriter; to buy and sell and keep the\\r\\naccounts; to read every letter received, and write or read every letter\\r\\nsent; to superintend the discharge of imports night and day; to be upon\\r\\nmany parts of the coast almost at the same time;—often the richest\\r\\nfreight will be discharged upon a Jersey shore;—to be your own\\r\\ntelegraph, unweariedly sweeping the horizon, speaking all passing\\r\\nvessels bound coastwise; to keep up a steady despatch of commodities,\\r\\nfor the supply of such a distant and exorbitant market; to keep\\r\\nyourself informed of the state of the markets, prospects of war and\\r\\npeace every where, and anticipate the tendencies of trade and\\r\\ncivilization,—taking advantage of the results of all exploring\\r\\nexpeditions, using new passages and all improvements in\\r\\nnavigation;—charts to be studied, the position of reefs and new lights\\r\\nand buoys to be ascertained, and ever, and ever, the logarithmic tables\\r\\nto be corrected, for by the error of some calculator the vessel often\\r\\nsplits upon a rock that should have reached a friendly pier,—there is\\r\\nthe untold fate of La Perouse;—universal science to be kept pace with,\\r\\nstudying the lives of all great discoverers and navigators, great\\r\\nadventurers and merchants, from Hanno and the Phœnicians down to our\\r\\nday; in fine, account of stock to be taken from time to time, to know\\r\\nhow you stand. It is a labor to task the faculties of a man,—such\\r\\nproblems of profit and loss, of interest, of tare and tret, and gauging\\r\\nof all kinds in it, as demand a universal knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have thought that Walden Pond would be a good place for business, not\\r\\nsolely on account of the railroad and the ice trade; it offers\\r\\nadvantages which it may not be good policy to divulge; it is a good\\r\\nport and a good foundation. No Neva marshes to be filled; though you\\r\\nmust every where build on piles of your own driving. It is said that a\\r\\nflood-tide, with a westerly wind, and ice in the Neva, would sweep St.\\r\\nPetersburg from the face of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this business was to be entered into without the usual capital, it\\r\\nmay not be easy to conjecture where those means, that will still be\\r\\nindispensable to every such undertaking, were to be obtained. As for\\r\\nClothing, to come at once to the practical part of the question,\\r\\nperhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty, and a regard for the\\r\\nopinions of men, in procuring it, than by a true utility. Let him who\\r\\nhas work to do recollect that the object of clothing is, first, to\\r\\nretain the vital heat, and secondly, in this state of society, to cover\\r\\nnakedness, and he may judge how much of any necessary or important work\\r\\nmay be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe. Kings and queens\\r\\nwho wear a suit but once, though made by some tailor or dressmaker to\\r\\ntheir majesties, cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits.\\r\\nThey are no better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on.\\r\\nEvery day our garments become more assimilated to ourselves, receiving\\r\\nthe impress of the wearer’s character, until we hesitate to lay them\\r\\naside, without such delay and medical appliances and some such\\r\\nsolemnity even as our bodies. No man ever stood the lower in my\\r\\nestimation for having a patch in his clothes; yet I am sure that there\\r\\nis greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean\\r\\nand unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience. But even if the\\r\\nrent is not mended, perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence. I\\r\\nsometimes try my acquaintances by such tests as this;—who could wear a\\r\\npatch, or two extra seams only, over the knee? Most behave as if they\\r\\nbelieved that their prospects for life would be ruined if they should\\r\\ndo it. It would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg\\r\\nthan with a broken pantaloon. Often if an accident happens to a\\r\\ngentleman’s legs, they can be mended; but if a similar accident happens\\r\\nto the legs of his pantaloons, there is no help for it; for he\\r\\nconsiders, not what is truly respectable, but what is respected. We\\r\\nknow but few men, a great many coats and breeches. Dress a scarecrow in\\r\\nyour last shift, you standing shiftless by, who would not soonest\\r\\nsalute the scarecrow? Passing a cornfield the other day, close by a hat\\r\\nand coat on a stake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only a\\r\\nlittle more weather-beaten than when I saw him last. I have heard of a\\r\\ndog that barked at every stranger who approached his master’s premises\\r\\nwith clothes on, but was easily quieted by a naked thief. It is an\\r\\ninteresting question how far men would retain their relative rank if\\r\\nthey were divested of their clothes. Could you, in such a case, tell\\r\\nsurely of any company of civilized men, which belonged to the most\\r\\nrespected class? When Madam Pfeiffer, in her adventurous travels round\\r\\nthe world, from east to west, had got so near home as Asiatic Russia,\\r\\nshe says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than a travelling\\r\\ndress, when she went to meet the authorities, for she “was now in a\\r\\ncivilized country, where —— — people are judged of by their clothes.”\\r\\nEven in our democratic New England towns the accidental possession of\\r\\nwealth, and its manifestation in dress and equipage alone, obtain for\\r\\nthe possessor almost universal respect. But they yield such respect,\\r\\nnumerous as they are, are so far heathen, and need to have a missionary\\r\\nsent to them. Beside, clothes introduced sewing, a kind of work which\\r\\nyou may call endless; a woman’s dress, at least, is never done.\\r\\n\\r\\nA man who has at length found something to do will not need to get a\\r\\nnew suit to do it in; for him the old will do, that has lain dusty in\\r\\nthe garret for an indeterminate period. Old shoes will serve a hero\\r\\nlonger than they have served his valet,—if a hero ever has a\\r\\nvalet,—bare feet are older than shoes, and he can make them do. Only\\r\\nthey who go to soirées and legislative halls must have new coats, coats\\r\\nto change as often as the man changes in them. But if my jacket and\\r\\ntrousers, my hat and shoes, are fit to worship God in, they will do;\\r\\nwill they not? Who ever saw his old clothes,—his old coat, actually\\r\\nworn out, resolved into its primitive elements, so that it was not a\\r\\ndeed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy, by him perchance to be\\r\\nbestowed on some poorer still, or shall we say richer, who could do\\r\\nwith less? I say, beware of all enterprises that require new clothes,\\r\\nand not rather a new wearer of clothes. If there is not a new man, how\\r\\ncan the new clothes be made to fit? If you have any enterprise before\\r\\nyou, try it in your old clothes. All men want, not something to _do\\r\\nwith_, but something to _do_, or rather something to _be_. Perhaps we\\r\\nshould never procure a new suit, however ragged or dirty the old, until\\r\\nwe have so conducted, so enterprised or sailed in some way, that we\\r\\nfeel like new men in the old, and that to retain it would be like\\r\\nkeeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season, like that of the\\r\\nfowls, must be a crisis in our lives. The loon retires to solitary\\r\\nponds to spend it. Thus also the snake casts its slough, and the\\r\\ncaterpillar its wormy coat, by an internal industry and expansion; for\\r\\nclothes are but our outmost cuticle and mortal coil. Otherwise we shall\\r\\nbe found sailing under false colors, and be inevitably cashiered at\\r\\nlast by our own opinion, as well as that of mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe don garment after garment, as if we grew like exogenous plants by\\r\\naddition without. Our outside and often thin and fanciful clothes are\\r\\nour epidermis, or false skin, which partakes not of our life, and may\\r\\nbe stripped off here and there without fatal injury; our thicker\\r\\ngarments, constantly worn, are our cellular integument, or cortex; but\\r\\nour shirts are our liber or true bark, which cannot be removed without\\r\\ngirdling and so destroying the man. I believe that all races at some\\r\\nseasons wear something equivalent to the shirt. It is desirable that a\\r\\nman be clad so simply that he can lay his hands on himself in the dark,\\r\\nand that he live in all respects so compactly and preparedly, that, if\\r\\nan enemy take the town, he can, like the old philosopher, walk out the\\r\\ngate empty-handed without anxiety. While one thick garment is, for most\\r\\npurposes, as good as three thin ones, and cheap clothing can be\\r\\nobtained at prices really to suit customers; while a thick coat can be\\r\\nbought for five dollars, which will last as many years, thick\\r\\npantaloons for two dollars, cowhide boots for a dollar and a half a\\r\\npair, a summer hat for a quarter of a dollar, and a winter cap for\\r\\nsixty-two and a half cents, or a better be made at home at a nominal\\r\\ncost, where is he so poor that, clad in such a suit, of _his own\\r\\nearning_, there will not be found wise men to do him reverence?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I ask for a garment of a particular form, my tailoress tells me\\r\\ngravely, “They do not make them so now,” not emphasizing the “They” at\\r\\nall, as if she quoted an authority as impersonal as the Fates, and I\\r\\nfind it difficult to get made what I want, simply because she cannot\\r\\nbelieve that I mean what I say, that I am so rash. When I hear this\\r\\noracular sentence, I am for a moment absorbed in thought, emphasizing\\r\\nto myself each word separately that I may come at the meaning of it,\\r\\nthat I may find out by what degree of consanguinity _They_ are related\\r\\nto _me_, and what authority they may have in an affair which affects me\\r\\nso nearly; and, finally, I am inclined to answer her with equal\\r\\nmystery, and without any more emphasis of the “they,”—“It is true, they\\r\\ndid not make them so recently, but they do now.” Of what use this\\r\\nmeasuring of me if she does not measure my character, but only the\\r\\nbreadth of my shoulders, as it were a peg to hang the coat on? We\\r\\nworship not the Graces, nor the Parcæ, but Fashion. She spins and\\r\\nweaves and cuts with full authority. The head monkey at Paris puts on a\\r\\ntraveller’s cap, and all the monkeys in America do the same. I\\r\\nsometimes despair of getting anything quite simple and honest done in\\r\\nthis world by the help of men. They would have to be passed through a\\r\\npowerful press first, to squeeze their old notions out of them, so that\\r\\nthey would not soon get upon their legs again, and then there would be\\r\\nsome one in the company with a maggot in his head, hatched from an egg\\r\\ndeposited there nobody knows when, for not even fire kills these\\r\\nthings, and you would have lost your labor. Nevertheless, we will not\\r\\nforget that some Egyptian wheat was handed down to us by a mummy.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the whole, I think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has in\\r\\nthis or any country risen to the dignity of an art. At present men make\\r\\nshift to wear what they can get. Like shipwrecked sailors, they put on\\r\\nwhat they can find on the beach, and at a little distance, whether of\\r\\nspace or time, laugh at each other’s masquerade. Every generation\\r\\nlaughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new. We are\\r\\namused at beholding the costume of Henry VIII., or Queen Elizabeth, as\\r\\nmuch as if it was that of the King and Queen of the Cannibal Islands.\\r\\nAll costume off a man is pitiful or grotesque. It is only the serious\\r\\neye peering from and the sincere life passed within it, which restrain\\r\\nlaughter and consecrate the costume of any people. Let Harlequin be\\r\\ntaken with a fit of the colic and his trappings will have to serve that\\r\\nmood too. When the soldier is hit by a cannon ball rags are as becoming\\r\\nas purple.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe childish and savage taste of men and women for new patterns keeps\\r\\nhow many shaking and squinting through kaleidoscopes that they may\\r\\ndiscover the particular figure which this generation requires today.\\r\\nThe manufacturers have learned that this taste is merely whimsical. Of\\r\\ntwo patterns which differ only by a few threads more or less of a\\r\\nparticular color, the one will be sold readily, the other lie on the\\r\\nshelf, though it frequently happens that after the lapse of a season\\r\\nthe latter becomes the most fashionable. Comparatively, tattooing is\\r\\nnot the hideous custom which it is called. It is not barbarous merely\\r\\nbecause the printing is skin-deep and unalterable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men\\r\\nmay get clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day\\r\\nmore like that of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as\\r\\nfar as I have heard or observed, the principal object is, not that\\r\\nmankind may be well and honestly clad, but, unquestionably, that\\r\\ncorporations may be enriched. In the long run men hit only what they\\r\\naim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately, they had better\\r\\naim at something high.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for a Shelter, I will not deny that this is now a necessary of life,\\r\\nthough there are instances of men having done without it for long\\r\\nperiods in colder countries than this. Samuel Laing says that “the\\r\\nLaplander in his skin dress, and in a skin bag which he puts over his\\r\\nhead and shoulders, will sleep night after night on the snow—in a\\r\\ndegree of cold which would extinguish the life of one exposed to it in\\r\\nany woollen clothing.” He had seen them asleep thus. Yet he adds, “They\\r\\nare not hardier than other people.” But, probably, man did not live\\r\\nlong on the earth without discovering the convenience which there is in\\r\\na house, the domestic comforts, which phrase may have originally\\r\\nsignified the satisfactions of the house more than of the family;\\r\\nthough these must be extremely partial and occasional in those climates\\r\\nwhere the house is associated in our thoughts with winter or the rainy\\r\\nseason chiefly, and two thirds of the year, except for a parasol, is\\r\\nunnecessary. In our climate, in the summer, it was formerly almost\\r\\nsolely a covering at night. In the Indian gazettes a wigwam was the\\r\\nsymbol of a day’s march, and a row of them cut or painted on the bark\\r\\nof a tree signified that so many times they had camped. Man was not\\r\\nmade so large limbed and robust but that he must seek to narrow his\\r\\nworld, and wall in a space such as fitted him. He was at first bare and\\r\\nout of doors; but though this was pleasant enough in serene and warm\\r\\nweather, by daylight, the rainy season and the winter, to say nothing\\r\\nof the torrid sun, would perhaps have nipped his race in the bud if he\\r\\nhad not made haste to clothe himself with the shelter of a house. Adam\\r\\nand Eve, according to the fable, wore the bower before other clothes.\\r\\nMan wanted a home, a place of warmth, or comfort, first of physical\\r\\nwarmth, then the warmth of the affections.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe may imagine a time when, in the infancy of the human race, some\\r\\nenterprising mortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter. Every\\r\\nchild begins the world again, to some extent, and loves to stay out\\r\\ndoors, even in wet and cold. It plays house, as well as horse, having\\r\\nan instinct for it. Who does not remember the interest with which when\\r\\nyoung he looked at shelving rocks, or any approach to a cave? It was\\r\\nthe natural yearning of that portion of our most primitive ancestor\\r\\nwhich still survived in us. From the cave we have advanced to roofs of\\r\\npalm leaves, of bark and boughs, of linen woven and stretched, of grass\\r\\nand straw, of boards and shingles, of stones and tiles. At last, we\\r\\nknow not what it is to live in the open air, and our lives are domestic\\r\\nin more senses than we think. From the hearth to the field is a great\\r\\ndistance. It would be well perhaps if we were to spend more of our days\\r\\nand nights without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies,\\r\\nif the poet did not speak so much from under a roof, or the saint dwell\\r\\nthere so long. Birds do not sing in caves, nor do doves cherish their\\r\\ninnocence in dovecots.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if one designs to construct a dwelling house, it behooves him\\r\\nto exercise a little Yankee shrewdness, lest after all he find himself\\r\\nin a workhouse, a labyrinth without a clue, a museum, an almshouse, a\\r\\nprison, or a splendid mausoleum instead. Consider first how slight a\\r\\nshelter is absolutely necessary. I have seen Penobscot Indians, in this\\r\\ntown, living in tents of thin cotton cloth, while the snow was nearly a\\r\\nfoot deep around them, and I thought that they would be glad to have it\\r\\ndeeper to keep out the wind. Formerly, when how to get my living\\r\\nhonestly, with freedom left for my proper pursuits, was a question\\r\\nwhich vexed me even more than it does now, for unfortunately I am\\r\\nbecome somewhat callous, I used to see a large box by the railroad, six\\r\\nfeet long by three wide, in which the laborers locked up their tools at\\r\\nnight, and it suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed might\\r\\nget such a one for a dollar, and, having bored a few auger holes in it,\\r\\nto admit the air at least, get into it when it rained and at night, and\\r\\nhook down the lid, and so have freedom in his love, and in his soul be\\r\\nfree. This did not appear the worst, nor by any means a despicable\\r\\nalternative. You could sit up as late as you pleased, and, whenever you\\r\\ngot up, go abroad without any landlord or house-lord dogging you for\\r\\nrent. Many a man is harassed to death to pay the rent of a larger and\\r\\nmore luxurious box who would not have frozen to death in such a box as\\r\\nthis. I am far from jesting. Economy is a subject which admits of being\\r\\ntreated with levity, but it cannot so be disposed of. A comfortable\\r\\nhouse for a rude and hardy race, that lived mostly out of doors, was\\r\\nonce made here almost entirely of such materials as Nature furnished\\r\\nready to their hands. Gookin, who was superintendent of the Indians\\r\\nsubject to the Massachusetts Colony, writing in 1674, says, “The best\\r\\nof their houses are covered very neatly, tight and warm, with barks of\\r\\ntrees, slipped from their bodies at those seasons when the sap is up,\\r\\nand made into great flakes, with pressure of weighty timber, when they\\r\\nare green.... The meaner sort are covered with mats which they make of\\r\\na kind of bulrush, and are also indifferently tight and warm, but not\\r\\nso good as the former.... Some I have seen, sixty or a hundred feet\\r\\nlong and thirty feet broad.... I have often lodged in their wigwams,\\r\\nand found them as warm as the best English houses.” He adds, that they\\r\\nwere commonly carpeted and lined within with well-wrought embroidered\\r\\nmats, and were furnished with various utensils. The Indians had\\r\\nadvanced so far as to regulate the effect of the wind by a mat\\r\\nsuspended over the hole in the roof and moved by a string. Such a lodge\\r\\nwas in the first instance constructed in a day or two at most, and\\r\\ntaken down and put up in a few hours; and every family owned one, or\\r\\nits apartment in one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best,\\r\\nand sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I\\r\\nspeak within bounds when I say that, though the birds of the air have\\r\\ntheir nests, and the foxes their holes, and the savages their wigwams,\\r\\nin modern civilized society not more than one half the families own a\\r\\nshelter. In the large towns and cities, where civilization especially\\r\\nprevails, the number of those who own a shelter is a very small\\r\\nfraction of the whole. The rest pay an annual tax for this outside\\r\\ngarment of all, become indispensable summer and winter, which would buy\\r\\na village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as long as\\r\\nthey live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring\\r\\ncompared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his\\r\\nshelter because it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his\\r\\ncommonly because he cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long\\r\\nrun, any better afford to hire. But, answers one, by merely paying this\\r\\ntax the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared\\r\\nwith the savage’s. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred\\r\\ndollars, these are the country rates, entitles him to the benefit of\\r\\nthe improvements of centuries, spacious apartments, clean paint and\\r\\npaper, Rumford fireplace, back plastering, Venetian blinds, copper\\r\\npump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things. But how\\r\\nhappens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a\\r\\n_poor_ civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a\\r\\nsavage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the\\r\\ncondition of man,—and I think that it is, though only the wise improve\\r\\ntheir advantages,—it must be shown that it has produced better\\r\\ndwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is\\r\\nthe amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged\\r\\nfor it, immediately or in the long run. An average house in this\\r\\nneighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars, and to lay up this\\r\\nsum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer’s life, even if\\r\\nhe is not encumbered with a family;—estimating the pecuniary value of\\r\\nevery man’s labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive more, others\\r\\nreceive less;—so that he must have spent more than half his life\\r\\ncommonly before _his_ wigwam will be earned. If we suppose him to pay a\\r\\nrent instead, this is but a doubtful choice of evils. Would the savage\\r\\nhave been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be guessed that I reduce almost the whole advantage of holding\\r\\nthis superfluous property as a fund in store against the future, so far\\r\\nas the individual is concerned, mainly to the defraying of funeral\\r\\nexpenses. But perhaps a man is not required to bury himself.\\r\\nNevertheless this points to an important distinction between the\\r\\ncivilized man and the savage; and, no doubt, they have designs on us\\r\\nfor our benefit, in making the life of a civilized people an\\r\\n_institution_, in which the life of the individual is to a great extent\\r\\nabsorbed, in order to preserve and perfect that of the race. But I wish\\r\\nto show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present obtained, and\\r\\nto suggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantage\\r\\nwithout suffering any of the disadvantage. What mean ye by saying that\\r\\nthe poor ye have always with you, or that the fathers have eaten sour\\r\\ngrapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge?\\r\\n\\r\\n“As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to\\r\\nuse this proverb in Israel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Behold all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul\\r\\nof the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least\\r\\nas well off as the other classes, I find that for the most part they\\r\\nhave been toiling twenty, thirty, or forty years, that they may become\\r\\nthe real owners of their farms, which commonly they have inherited with\\r\\nencumbrances, or else bought with hired money,—and we may regard one\\r\\nthird of that toil as the cost of their houses,—but commonly they have\\r\\nnot paid for them yet. It is true, the encumbrances sometimes outweigh\\r\\nthe value of the farm, so that the farm itself becomes one great\\r\\nencumbrance, and still a man is found to inherit it, being well\\r\\nacquainted with it, as he says. On applying to the assessors, I am\\r\\nsurprised to learn that they cannot at once name a dozen in the town\\r\\nwho own their farms free and clear. If you would know the history of\\r\\nthese homesteads, inquire at the bank where they are mortgaged. The man\\r\\nwho has actually paid for his farm with labor on it is so rare that\\r\\nevery neighbor can point to him. I doubt if there are three such men in\\r\\nConcord. What has been said of the merchants, that a very large\\r\\nmajority, even ninety-seven in a hundred, are sure to fail, is equally\\r\\ntrue of the farmers. With regard to the merchants, however, one of them\\r\\nsays pertinently that a great part of their failures are not genuine\\r\\npecuniary failures, but merely failures to fulfil their engagements,\\r\\nbecause it is inconvenient; that is, it is the moral character that\\r\\nbreaks down. But this puts an infinitely worse face on the matter, and\\r\\nsuggests, beside, that probably not even the other three succeed in\\r\\nsaving their souls, but are perchance bankrupt in a worse sense than\\r\\nthey who fail honestly. Bankruptcy and repudiation are the springboards\\r\\nfrom which much of our civilization vaults and turns its somersets, but\\r\\nthe savage stands on the unelastic plank of famine. Yet the Middlesex\\r\\nCattle Show goes off here with _éclat_ annually, as if all the joints\\r\\nof the agricultural machine were suent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe farmer is endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by a\\r\\nformula more complicated than the problem itself. To get his\\r\\nshoestrings he speculates in herds of cattle. With consummate skill he\\r\\nhas set his trap with a hair spring to catch comfort and independence,\\r\\nand then, as he turned away, got his own leg into it. This is the\\r\\nreason he is poor; and for a similar reason we are all poor in respect\\r\\nto a thousand savage comforts, though surrounded by luxuries. As\\r\\nChapman sings,—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “The false society of men—\\r\\n             —for earthly greatness\\r\\n     All heavenly comforts rarefies to air.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when the farmer has got his house, he may not be the richer but the\\r\\npoorer for it, and it be the house that has got him. As I understand\\r\\nit, that was a valid objection urged by Momus against the house which\\r\\nMinerva made, that she “had not made it movable, by which means a bad\\r\\nneighborhood might be avoided;” and it may still be urged, for our\\r\\nhouses are such unwieldy property that we are often imprisoned rather\\r\\nthan housed in them; and the bad neighborhood to be avoided is our own\\r\\nscurvy selves. I know one or two families, at least, in this town, who,\\r\\nfor nearly a generation, have been wishing to sell their houses in the\\r\\noutskirts and move into the village, but have not been able to\\r\\naccomplish it, and only death will set them free.\\r\\n\\r\\nGranted that the _majority_ are able at last either to own or hire the\\r\\nmodern house with all its improvements. While civilization has been\\r\\nimproving our houses, it has not equally improved the men who are to\\r\\ninhabit them. It has created palaces, but it was not so easy to create\\r\\nnoblemen and kings. And _if the civilized man’s pursuits are no\\r\\nworthier than the savage’s, if he is employed the greater part of his\\r\\nlife in obtaining gross necessaries and comforts merely, why should he\\r\\nhave a better dwelling than the former?_\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how do the poor minority fare? Perhaps it will be found, that just\\r\\nin proportion as some have been placed in outward circumstances above\\r\\nthe savage, others have been degraded below him. The luxury of one\\r\\nclass is counterbalanced by the indigence of another. On the one side\\r\\nis the palace, on the other are the almshouse and “silent poor.” The\\r\\nmyriads who built the pyramids to be the tombs of the Pharaohs were fed\\r\\non garlic, and it may be were not decently buried themselves. The mason\\r\\nwho finishes the cornice of the palace returns at night perchance to a\\r\\nhut not so good as a wigwam. It is a mistake to suppose that, in a\\r\\ncountry where the usual evidences of civilization exist, the condition\\r\\nof a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as that\\r\\nof savages. I refer to the degraded poor, not now to the degraded rich.\\r\\nTo know this I should not need to look farther than to the shanties\\r\\nwhich every where border our railroads, that last improvement in\\r\\ncivilization; where I see in my daily walks human beings living in\\r\\nsties, and all winter with an open door, for the sake of light, without\\r\\nany visible, often imaginable, wood pile, and the forms of both old and\\r\\nyoung are permanently contracted by the long habit of shrinking from\\r\\ncold and misery, and the development of all their limbs and faculties\\r\\nis checked. It certainly is fair to look at that class by whose labor\\r\\nthe works which distinguish this generation are accomplished. Such too,\\r\\nto a greater or less extent, is the condition of the operatives of\\r\\nevery denomination in England, which is the great workhouse of the\\r\\nworld. Or I could refer you to Ireland, which is marked as one of the\\r\\nwhite or enlightened spots on the map. Contrast the physical condition\\r\\nof the Irish with that of the North American Indian, or the South Sea\\r\\nIslander, or any other savage race before it was degraded by contact\\r\\nwith the civilized man. Yet I have no doubt that that people’s rulers\\r\\nare as wise as the average of civilized rulers. Their condition only\\r\\nproves what squalidness may consist with civilization. I hardly need\\r\\nrefer now to the laborers in our Southern States who produce the staple\\r\\nexports of this country, and are themselves a staple production of the\\r\\nSouth. But to confine myself to those who are said to be in _moderate_\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are\\r\\nactually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that\\r\\nthey must have such a one as their neighbors have. As if one were to\\r\\nwear any sort of coat which the tailor might cut out for him, or,\\r\\ngradually leaving off palmleaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin, complain\\r\\nof hard times because he could not afford to buy him a crown! It is\\r\\npossible to invent a house still more convenient and luxurious than we\\r\\nhave, which yet all would admit that man could not afford to pay for.\\r\\nShall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not sometimes\\r\\nto be content with less? Shall the respectable citizen thus gravely\\r\\nteach, by precept and example, the necessity of the young man’s\\r\\nproviding a certain number of superfluous glow-shoes, and umbrellas,\\r\\nand empty guest chambers for empty guests, before he dies? Why should\\r\\nnot our furniture be as simple as the Arab’s or the Indian’s? When I\\r\\nthink of the benefactors of the race, whom we have apotheosized as\\r\\nmessengers from heaven, bearers of divine gifts to man, I do not see in\\r\\nmy mind any retinue at their heels, any car-load of fashionable\\r\\nfurniture. Or what if I were to allow—would it not be a singular\\r\\nallowance?—that our furniture should be more complex than the Arab’s,\\r\\nin proportion as we are morally and intellectually his superiors! At\\r\\npresent our houses are cluttered and defiled with it, and a good\\r\\nhousewife would sweep out the greater part into the dust hole, and not\\r\\nleave her morning’s work undone. Morning work! By the blushes of Aurora\\r\\nand the music of Memnon, what should be man’s _morning work_ in this\\r\\nworld? I had three pieces of limestone on my desk, but I was terrified\\r\\nto find that they required to be dusted daily, when the furniture of my\\r\\nmind was all undusted still, and I threw them out the window in\\r\\ndisgust. How, then, could I have a furnished house? I would rather sit\\r\\nin the open air, for no dust gathers on the grass, unless where man has\\r\\nbroken ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is the luxurious and dissipated who set the fashions which the herd\\r\\nso diligently follow. The traveller who stops at the best houses, so\\r\\ncalled, soon discovers this, for the publicans presume him to be a\\r\\nSardanapalus, and if he resigned himself to their tender mercies he\\r\\nwould soon be completely emasculated. I think that in the railroad car\\r\\nwe are inclined to spend more on luxury than on safety and convenience,\\r\\nand it threatens without attaining these to become no better than a\\r\\nmodern drawing room, with its divans, and ottomans, and sun-shades, and\\r\\na hundred other oriental things, which we are taking west with us,\\r\\ninvented for the ladies of the harem and the effeminate natives of the\\r\\nCelestial Empire, which Jonathan should be ashamed to know the names\\r\\nof. I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be\\r\\ncrowded on a velvet cushion. I would rather ride on earth in an ox cart\\r\\nwith a free circulation, than go to heaven in the fancy car of an\\r\\nexcursion train and breathe a _malaria_ all the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe very simplicity and nakedness of man’s life in the primitive ages\\r\\nimply this advantage at least, that they left him still but a sojourner\\r\\nin nature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep he contemplated\\r\\nhis journey again. He dwelt, as it were, in a tent in this world, and\\r\\nwas either threading the valleys, or crossing the plains, or climbing\\r\\nthe mountain tops. But lo! men have become the tools of their tools.\\r\\nThe man who independently plucked the fruits when he was hungry is\\r\\nbecome a farmer; and he who stood under a tree for shelter, a\\r\\nhousekeeper. We now no longer camp as for a night, but have settled\\r\\ndown on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted Christianity merely\\r\\nas an improved method of _agri_-culture. We have built for this world a\\r\\nfamily mansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art\\r\\nare the expression of man’s struggle to free himself from this\\r\\ncondition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state\\r\\ncomfortable and that higher state to be forgotten. There is actually no\\r\\nplace in this village for a work of _fine_ art, if any had come down to\\r\\nus, to stand, for our lives, our houses and streets, furnish no proper\\r\\npedestal for it. There is not a nail to hang a picture on, nor a shelf\\r\\nto receive the bust of a hero or a saint. When I consider how our\\r\\nhouses are built and paid for, or not paid for, and their internal\\r\\neconomy managed and sustained, I wonder that the floor does not give\\r\\nway under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon the\\r\\nmantel-piece, and let him through into the cellar, to some solid and\\r\\nhonest though earthy foundation. I cannot but perceive that this so\\r\\ncalled rich and refined life is a thing jumped at, and I do not get on\\r\\nin the enjoyment of the _fine_ arts which adorn it, my attention being\\r\\nwholly occupied with the jump; for I remember that the greatest genuine\\r\\nleap, due to human muscles alone, on record, is that of certain\\r\\nwandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on level\\r\\nground. Without factitious support, man is sure to come to earth again\\r\\nbeyond that distance. The first question which I am tempted to put to\\r\\nthe proprietor of such great impropriety is, Who bolsters you? Are you\\r\\none of the ninety-seven who fail, or of the three who succeed? Answer\\r\\nme these questions, and then perhaps I may look at your bawbles and\\r\\nfind them ornamental. The cart before the horse is neither beautiful\\r\\nnor useful. Before we can adorn our houses with beautiful objects the\\r\\nwalls must be stripped, and our lives must be stripped, and beautiful\\r\\nhousekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a foundation: now, a\\r\\ntaste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors, where there is\\r\\nno house and no housekeeper.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Johnson, in his “Wonder-Working Providence,” speaking of the first\\r\\nsettlers of this town, with whom he was contemporary, tells us that\\r\\n“they burrow themselves in the earth for their first shelter under some\\r\\nhillside, and, casting the soil aloft upon timber, they make a smoky\\r\\nfire against the earth, at the highest side.” They did not “provide\\r\\nthem houses,” says he, “till the earth, by the Lord’s blessing, brought\\r\\nforth bread to feed them,” and the first year’s crop was so light that\\r\\n“they were forced to cut their bread very thin for a long season.” The\\r\\nsecretary of the Province of New Netherland, writing in Dutch, in 1650,\\r\\nfor the information of those who wished to take up land there, states\\r\\nmore particularly that “those in New Netherland, and especially in New\\r\\nEngland, who have no means to build farmhouses at first according to\\r\\ntheir wishes, dig a square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, six or\\r\\nseven feet deep, as long and as broad as they think proper, case the\\r\\nearth inside with wood all round the wall, and line the wood with the\\r\\nbark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earth;\\r\\nfloor this cellar with plank, and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling,\\r\\nraise a roof of spars clear up, and cover the spars with bark or green\\r\\nsods, so that they can live dry and warm in these houses with their\\r\\nentire families for two, three, and four years, it being understood\\r\\nthat partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to the\\r\\nsize of the family. The wealthy and principal men in New England, in\\r\\nthe beginning of the colonies, commenced their first dwelling houses in\\r\\nthis fashion for two reasons; firstly, in order not to waste time in\\r\\nbuilding, and not to want food the next season; secondly, in order not\\r\\nto discourage poor laboring people whom they brought over in numbers\\r\\nfrom Fatherland. In the course of three or four years, when the country\\r\\nbecame adapted to agriculture, they built themselves handsome houses,\\r\\nspending on them several thousands.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this course which our ancestors took there was a show of prudence at\\r\\nleast, as if their principle were to satisfy the more pressing wants\\r\\nfirst. But are the more pressing wants satisfied now? When I think of\\r\\nacquiring for myself one of our luxurious dwellings, I am deterred,\\r\\nfor, so to speak, the country is not yet adapted to _human_ culture,\\r\\nand we are still forced to cut our _spiritual_ bread far thinner than\\r\\nour forefathers did their wheaten. Not that all architectural ornament\\r\\nis to be neglected even in the rudest periods; but let our houses first\\r\\nbe lined with beauty, where they come in contact with our lives, like\\r\\nthe tenement of the shellfish, and not overlaid with it. But, alas! I\\r\\nhave been inside one or two of them, and know what they are lined with.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough we are not so degenerate but that we might possibly live in a\\r\\ncave or a wigwam or wear skins today, it certainly is better to accept\\r\\nthe advantages, though so dearly bought, which the invention and\\r\\nindustry of mankind offer. In such a neighborhood as this, boards and\\r\\nshingles, lime and bricks, are cheaper and more easily obtained than\\r\\nsuitable caves, or whole logs, or bark in sufficient quantities, or\\r\\neven well-tempered clay or flat stones. I speak understandingly on this\\r\\nsubject, for I have made myself acquainted with it both theoretically\\r\\nand practically. With a little more wit we might use these materials so\\r\\nas to become richer than the richest now are, and make our civilization\\r\\na blessing. The civilized man is a more experienced and wiser savage.\\r\\nBut to make haste to my own experiment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and went down to the\\r\\nwoods by Walden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house,\\r\\nand began to cut down some tall, arrowy white pines, still in their\\r\\nyouth, for timber. It is difficult to begin without borrowing, but\\r\\nperhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellow-men\\r\\nto have an interest in your enterprise. The owner of the axe, as he\\r\\nreleased his hold on it, said that it was the apple of his eye; but I\\r\\nreturned it sharper than I received it. It was a pleasant hillside\\r\\nwhere I worked, covered with pine woods, through which I looked out on\\r\\nthe pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories\\r\\nwere springing up. The ice in the pond was not yet dissolved, though\\r\\nthere were some open spaces, and it was all dark colored and saturated\\r\\nwith water. There were some slight flurries of snow during the days\\r\\nthat I worked there; but for the most part when I came out on to the\\r\\nrailroad, on my way home, its yellow sand heap stretched away gleaming\\r\\nin the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the spring sun, and I\\r\\nheard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence\\r\\nanother year with us. They were pleasant spring days, in which the\\r\\nwinter of man’s discontent was thawing as well as the earth, and the\\r\\nlife that had lain torpid began to stretch itself. One day, when my axe\\r\\nhad come off and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with\\r\\na stone, and had placed the whole to soak in a pond hole in order to\\r\\nswell the wood, I saw a striped snake run into the water, and he lay on\\r\\nthe bottom, apparently without inconvenience, as long as I stayed\\r\\nthere, or more than a quarter of an hour; perhaps because he had not\\r\\nyet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared to me that for a\\r\\nlike reason men remain in their present low and primitive condition;\\r\\nbut if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing\\r\\nthem, they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life.\\r\\nI had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with\\r\\nportions of their bodies still numb and inflexible, waiting for the sun\\r\\nto thaw them. On the 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and in\\r\\nthe early part of the day, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose\\r\\ngroping about over the pond and cackling as if lost, or like the spirit\\r\\nof the fog.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I went on for some days cutting and hewing timber, and also studs\\r\\nand rafters, all with my narrow axe, not having many communicable or\\r\\nscholar-like thoughts, singing to myself,—\\r\\n\\r\\n     Men say they know many things;\\r\\n     But lo! they have taken wings,—\\r\\n     The arts and sciences,\\r\\n     And a thousand appliances;\\r\\n     The wind that blows\\r\\n     Is all that any body knows.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hewed the main timbers six inches square, most of the studs on two\\r\\nsides only, and the rafters and floor timbers on one side, leaving the\\r\\nrest of the bark on, so that they were just as straight and much\\r\\nstronger than sawed ones. Each stick was carefully mortised or tenoned\\r\\nby its stump, for I had borrowed other tools by this time. My days in\\r\\nthe woods were not very long ones; yet I usually carried my dinner of\\r\\nbread and butter, and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped, at\\r\\nnoon, sitting amid the green pine boughs which I had cut off, and to my\\r\\nbread was imparted some of their fragrance, for my hands were covered\\r\\nwith a thick coat of pitch. Before I had done I was more the friend\\r\\nthan the foe of the pine tree, though I had cut down some of them,\\r\\nhaving become better acquainted with it. Sometimes a rambler in the\\r\\nwood was attracted by the sound of my axe, and we chatted pleasantly\\r\\nover the chips which I had made.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the middle of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather made\\r\\nthe most of it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had\\r\\nalready bought the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on\\r\\nthe Fitchburg Railroad, for boards. James Collins’ shanty was\\r\\nconsidered an uncommonly fine one. When I called to see it he was not\\r\\nat home. I walked about the outside, at first unobserved from within,\\r\\nthe window was so deep and high. It was of small dimensions, with a\\r\\npeaked cottage roof, and not much else to be seen, the dirt being\\r\\nraised five feet all around as if it were a compost heap. The roof was\\r\\nthe soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the\\r\\nsun. Door-sill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens\\r\\nunder the door board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it\\r\\nfrom the inside. The hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark,\\r\\nand had a dirt floor for the most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only\\r\\nhere a board and there a board which would not bear removal. She\\r\\nlighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls, and\\r\\nalso that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me not to\\r\\nstep into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own\\r\\nwords, they were “good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a\\r\\ngood window,”—of two whole squares originally, only the cat had passed\\r\\nout that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an\\r\\ninfant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed\\r\\nlooking-glass, and a patent new coffee mill nailed to an oak sapling,\\r\\nall told. The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the\\r\\nmeanwhile returned. I to pay four dollars and twenty-five cents\\r\\nto-night, he to vacate at five to-morrow morning, selling to nobody\\r\\nelse meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were well, he said, to\\r\\nbe there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust\\r\\nclaims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the\\r\\nonly encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One\\r\\nlarge bundle held their all,—bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens,—all\\r\\nbut the cat, she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I\\r\\nlearned afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a\\r\\ndead cat at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took down this dwelling the same morning, drawing the nails, and\\r\\nremoved it to the pond side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on\\r\\nthe grass there to bleach and warp back again in the sun. One early\\r\\nthrush gave me a note or two as I drove along the woodland path. I was\\r\\ninformed treacherously by a young Patrick that neighbor Seeley, an\\r\\nIrishman, in the intervals of the carting, transferred the still\\r\\ntolerable, straight, and drivable nails, staples, and spikes to his\\r\\npocket, and then stood when I came back to pass the time of day, and\\r\\nlook freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the devastation;\\r\\nthere being a dearth of work, as he said. He was there to represent\\r\\nspectatordom, and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with\\r\\nthe removal of the gods of Troy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dug my cellar in the side of a hill sloping to the south, where a\\r\\nwoodchuck had formerly dug his burrow, down through sumach and\\r\\nblackberry roots, and the lowest stain of vegetation, six feet square\\r\\nby seven deep, to a fine sand where potatoes would not freeze in any\\r\\nwinter. The sides were left shelving, and not stoned; but the sun\\r\\nhaving never shone on them, the sand still keeps its place. It was but\\r\\ntwo hours’ work. I took particular pleasure in this breaking of ground,\\r\\nfor in almost all latitudes men dig into the earth for an equable\\r\\ntemperature. Under the most splendid house in the city is still to be\\r\\nfound the cellar where they store their roots as of old, and long after\\r\\nthe superstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in the\\r\\nearth. The house is still but a sort of porch at the entrance of a\\r\\nburrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, in the beginning of May, with the help of some of my\\r\\nacquaintances, rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness\\r\\nthan from any necessity, I set up the frame of my house. No man was\\r\\never more honored in the character of his raisers than I. They are\\r\\ndestined, I trust, to assist at the raising of loftier structures one\\r\\nday. I began to occupy my house on the 4th of July, as soon as it was\\r\\nboarded and roofed, for the boards were carefully feather-edged and\\r\\nlapped, so that it was perfectly impervious to rain; but before\\r\\nboarding I laid the foundation of a chimney at one end, bringing two\\r\\ncartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms. I built the\\r\\nchimney after my hoeing in the fall, before a fire became necessary for\\r\\nwarmth, doing my cooking in the mean while out of doors on the ground,\\r\\nearly in the morning: which mode I still think is in some respects more\\r\\nconvenient and agreeable than the usual one. When it stormed before my\\r\\nbread was baked, I fixed a few boards over the fire, and sat under them\\r\\nto watch my loaf, and passed some pleasant hours in that way. In those\\r\\ndays, when my hands were much employed, I read but little, but the\\r\\nleast scraps of paper which lay on the ground, my holder, or\\r\\ntablecloth, afforded me as much entertainment, in fact answered the\\r\\nsame purpose as the Iliad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than I\\r\\ndid, considering, for instance, what foundation a door, a window, a\\r\\ncellar, a garret, have in the nature of man, and perchance never\\r\\nraising any superstructure until we found a better reason for it than\\r\\nour temporal necessities even. There is some of the same fitness in a\\r\\nman’s building his own house that there is in a bird’s building its own\\r\\nnest. Who knows but if men constructed their dwellings with their own\\r\\nhands, and provided food for themselves and families simply and\\r\\nhonestly enough, the poetic faculty would be universally developed, as\\r\\nbirds universally sing when they are so engaged? But alas! we do like\\r\\ncowbirds and cuckoos, which lay their eggs in nests which other birds\\r\\nhave built, and cheer no traveller with their chattering and unmusical\\r\\nnotes. Shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the\\r\\ncarpenter? What does architecture amount to in the experience of the\\r\\nmass of men? I never in all my walks came across a man engaged in so\\r\\nsimple and natural an occupation as building his house. We belong to\\r\\nthe community. It is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of a\\r\\nman; it is as much the preacher, and the merchant, and the farmer.\\r\\nWhere is this division of labor to end? and what object does it finally\\r\\nserve? No doubt another _may_ also think for me; but it is not\\r\\ntherefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of my\\r\\nthinking for myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue, there are architects so called in this country, and I have heard\\r\\nof one at least possessed with the idea of making architectural\\r\\nornaments have a core of truth, a necessity, and hence a beauty, as if\\r\\nit were a revelation to him. All very well perhaps from his point of\\r\\nview, but only a little better than the common dilettantism. A\\r\\nsentimental reformer in architecture, he began at the cornice, not at\\r\\nthe foundation. It was only how to put a core of truth within the\\r\\nornaments, that every sugar plum in fact might have an almond or\\r\\ncaraway seed in it,—though I hold that almonds are most wholesome\\r\\nwithout the sugar,—and not how the inhabitant, the indweller, might\\r\\nbuild truly within and without, and let the ornaments take care of\\r\\nthemselves. What reasonable man ever supposed that ornaments were\\r\\nsomething outward and in the skin merely,—that the tortoise got his\\r\\nspotted shell, or the shellfish its mother-o’-pearl tints, by such a\\r\\ncontract as the inhabitants of Broadway their Trinity Church? But a man\\r\\nhas no more to do with the style of architecture of his house than a\\r\\ntortoise with that of its shell: nor need the soldier be so idle as to\\r\\ntry to paint the precise color of his virtue on his standard. The enemy\\r\\nwill find it out. He may turn pale when the trial comes. This man\\r\\nseemed to me to lean over the cornice, and timidly whisper his half\\r\\ntruth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he. What of\\r\\narchitectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within\\r\\noutward, out of the necessities and character of the indweller, who is\\r\\nthe only builder,—out of some unconscious truthfulness, and nobleness,\\r\\nwithout ever a thought for the appearance and whatever additional\\r\\nbeauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded by a\\r\\nlike unconscious beauty of life. The most interesting dwellings in this\\r\\ncountry, as the painter knows, are the most unpretending, humble log\\r\\nhuts and cottages of the poor commonly; it is the life of the\\r\\ninhabitants whose shells they are, and not any peculiarity in their\\r\\nsurfaces merely, which makes them _picturesque;_ and equally\\r\\ninteresting will be the citizen’s suburban box, when his life shall be\\r\\nas simple and as agreeable to the imagination, and there is as little\\r\\nstraining after effect in the style of his dwelling. A great proportion\\r\\nof architectural ornaments are literally hollow, and a September gale\\r\\nwould strip them off, like borrowed plumes, without injury to the\\r\\nsubstantials. They can do without _architecture_ who have no olives nor\\r\\nwines in the cellar. What if an equal ado were made about the ornaments\\r\\nof style in literature, and the architects of our bibles spent as much\\r\\ntime about their cornices as the architects of our churches do? So are\\r\\nmade the _belles-lettres_ and the _beaux-arts_ and their professors.\\r\\nMuch it concerns a man, forsooth, how a few sticks are slanted over him\\r\\nor under him, and what colors are daubed upon his box. It would signify\\r\\nsomewhat, if, in any earnest sense, _he_ slanted them and daubed it;\\r\\nbut the spirit having departed out of the tenant, it is of a piece with\\r\\nconstructing his own coffin,—the architecture of the grave, and\\r\\n“carpenter” is but another name for “coffin-maker.” One man says, in\\r\\nhis despair or indifference to life, take up a handful of the earth at\\r\\nyour feet, and paint your house that color. Is he thinking of his last\\r\\nand narrow house? Toss up a copper for it as well. What an abundance of\\r\\nleisure he must have! Why do you take up a handful of dirt? Better\\r\\npaint your house your own complexion; let it turn pale or blush for\\r\\nyou. An enterprise to improve the style of cottage architecture! When\\r\\nyou have got my ornaments ready I will wear them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore winter I built a chimney, and shingled the sides of my house,\\r\\nwhich were already impervious to rain, with imperfect and sappy\\r\\nshingles made of the first slice of the log, whose edges I was obliged\\r\\nto straighten with a plane.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have thus a tight shingled and plastered house, ten feet wide by\\r\\nfifteen long, and eight-feet posts, with a garret and a closet, a large\\r\\nwindow on each side, two trap doors, one door at the end, and a brick\\r\\nfireplace opposite. The exact cost of my house, paying the usual price\\r\\nfor such materials as I used, but not counting the work, all of which\\r\\nwas done by myself, was as follows; and I give the details because very\\r\\nfew are able to tell exactly what their houses cost, and fewer still,\\r\\nif any, the separate cost of the various materials which compose them:—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    Boards.......................... $ 8.03½, mostly shanty boards.\\r\\n    Refuse shingles for roof sides,..  4.00\\r\\n    Laths,...........................  1.25\\r\\n    Two second-hand windows\\r\\n       with glass,...................  2.43\\r\\n    One thousand old brick,..........  4.00\\r\\n    Two casks of lime,...............  2.40  That was high.\\r\\n    Hair,............................  0.31  More than I needed.\\r\\n    Mantle-tree iron,................  0.15\\r\\n    Nails,...........................  3.90\\r\\n    Hinges and screws,...............  0.14\\r\\n    Latch,...........................  0.10\\r\\n    Chalk,...........................  0.01\\r\\n    Transportation,..................  1.40  I carried a good part\\r\\n                                     ———— on my back.\\r\\n        In all,..................... $28.12½\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are all the materials excepting the timber stones and sand, which\\r\\nI claimed by squatter’s right. I have also a small wood-shed adjoining,\\r\\nmade chiefly of the stuff which was left after building the house.\\r\\n\\r\\nI intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main street\\r\\nin Concord in grandeur and luxury, as soon as it pleases me as much and\\r\\nwill cost me no more than my present one.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thus found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one\\r\\nfor a lifetime at an expense not greater than the rent which he now\\r\\npays annually. If I seem to boast more than is becoming, my excuse is\\r\\nthat I brag for humanity rather than for myself; and my shortcomings\\r\\nand inconsistencies do not affect the truth of my statement.\\r\\nNotwithstanding much cant and hypocrisy,—chaff which I find it\\r\\ndifficult to separate from my wheat, but for which I am as sorry as any\\r\\nman,—I will breathe freely and stretch myself in this respect, it is\\r\\nsuch a relief to both the moral and physical system; and I am resolved\\r\\nthat I will not through humility become the devil’s attorney. I will\\r\\nendeavor to speak a good word for the truth. At Cambridge College the\\r\\nmere rent of a student’s room, which is only a little larger than my\\r\\nown, is thirty dollars each year, though the corporation had the\\r\\nadvantage of building thirty-two side by side and under one roof, and\\r\\nthe occupant suffers the inconvenience of many and noisy neighbors, and\\r\\nperhaps a residence in the fourth story. I cannot but think that if we\\r\\nhad more true wisdom in these respects, not only less education would\\r\\nbe needed, because, forsooth, more would already have been acquired,\\r\\nbut the pecuniary expense of getting an education would in a great\\r\\nmeasure vanish. Those conveniences which the student requires at\\r\\nCambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great a\\r\\nsacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides.\\r\\nThose things for which the most money is demanded are never the things\\r\\nwhich the student most wants. Tuition, for instance, is an important\\r\\nitem in the term bill, while for the far more valuable education which\\r\\nhe gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries\\r\\nno charge is made. The mode of founding a college is, commonly, to get\\r\\nup a subscription of dollars and cents, and then following blindly the\\r\\nprinciples of a division of labor to its extreme, a principle which\\r\\nshould never be followed but with circumspection,—to call in a\\r\\ncontractor who makes this a subject of speculation, and he employs\\r\\nIrishmen or other operatives actually to lay the foundations, while the\\r\\nstudents that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for it; and\\r\\nfor these oversights successive generations have to pay. I think that\\r\\nit would be _better than this_, for the students, or those who desire\\r\\nto be benefited by it, even to lay the foundation themselves. The\\r\\nstudent who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by\\r\\nsystematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an\\r\\nignoble and unprofitable leisure, defrauding himself of the experience\\r\\nwhich alone can make leisure fruitful. “But,” says one, “you do not\\r\\nmean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of\\r\\ntheir heads?” I do not mean that exactly, but I mean something which he\\r\\nmight think a good deal like that; I mean that they should not _play_\\r\\nlife, or _study_ it merely, while the community supports them at this\\r\\nexpensive game, but earnestly _live_ it from beginning to end. How\\r\\ncould youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment\\r\\nof living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as\\r\\nmathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and\\r\\nsciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is\\r\\nmerely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where any\\r\\nthing is professed and practised but the art of life;—to survey the\\r\\nworld through a telescope or a microscope, and never with his natural\\r\\neye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or\\r\\nmechanics, and not learn how it is earned; to discover new satellites\\r\\nto Neptune, and not detect the motes in his eyes, or to what vagabond\\r\\nhe is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm\\r\\nall around him, while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar.\\r\\nWhich would have advanced the most at the end of a month,—the boy who\\r\\nhad made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted,\\r\\nreading as much as would be necessary for this,—or the boy who had\\r\\nattended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the mean while,\\r\\nand had received a Rodgers’ penknife from his father? Which would be\\r\\nmost likely to cut his fingers?... To my astonishment I was informed on\\r\\nleaving college that I had studied navigation!—why, if I had taken one\\r\\nturn down the harbor I should have known more about it. Even the _poor_\\r\\nstudent studies and is taught only _political_ economy, while that\\r\\neconomy of living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even\\r\\nsincerely professed in our colleges. The consequence is, that while he\\r\\nis reading Adam Smith, Ricardo, and Say, he runs his father in debt\\r\\nirretrievably.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with our colleges, so with a hundred “modern improvements”; there is\\r\\nan illusion about them; there is not always a positive advance. The\\r\\ndevil goes on exacting compound interest to the last for his early\\r\\nshare and numerous succeeding investments in them. Our inventions are\\r\\nwont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious\\r\\nthings. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which\\r\\nit was already but too easy to arrive at; as railroads lead to Boston\\r\\nor New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph\\r\\nfrom Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing\\r\\nimportant to communicate. Either is in such a predicament as the man\\r\\nwho was earnest to be introduced to a distinguished deaf woman, but\\r\\nwhen he was presented, and one end of her ear trumpet was put into his\\r\\nhand, had nothing to say. As if the main object were to talk fast and\\r\\nnot to talk sensibly. We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and\\r\\nbring the old world some weeks nearer to the new; but perchance the\\r\\nfirst news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear\\r\\nwill be that the Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough. After all,\\r\\nthe man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most\\r\\nimportant messages; he is not an evangelist, nor does he come round\\r\\neating locusts and wild honey. I doubt if Flying Childers ever carried\\r\\na peck of corn to mill.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne says to me, “I wonder that you do not lay up money; you love to\\r\\ntravel; you might take the cars and go to Fitchburg to-day and see the\\r\\ncountry.” But I am wiser than that. I have learned that the swiftest\\r\\ntraveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my friend, Suppose we try who\\r\\nwill get there first. The distance is thirty miles; the fare ninety\\r\\ncents. That is almost a day’s wages. I remember when wages were sixty\\r\\ncents a day for laborers on this very road. Well, I start now on foot,\\r\\nand get there before night; I have travelled at that rate by the week\\r\\ntogether. You will in the mean while have earned your fare, and arrive\\r\\nthere some time to-morrow, or possibly this evening, if you are lucky\\r\\nenough to get a job in season. Instead of going to Fitchburg, you will\\r\\nbe working here the greater part of the day. And so, if the railroad\\r\\nreached round the world, I think that I should keep ahead of you; and\\r\\nas for seeing the country and getting experience of that kind, I should\\r\\nhave to cut your acquaintance altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with\\r\\nregard to the railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To\\r\\nmake a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalent\\r\\nto grading the whole surface of the planet. Men have an indistinct\\r\\nnotion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spades\\r\\nlong enough all will at length ride somewhere, in next to no time, and\\r\\nfor nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and the conductor\\r\\nshouts “All aboard!” when the smoke is blown away and the vapor\\r\\ncondensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the rest are\\r\\nrun over,—and it will be called, and will be, “A melancholy accident.”\\r\\nNo doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their fare, that\\r\\nis, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their\\r\\nelasticity and desire to travel by that time. This spending of the best\\r\\npart of one’s life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable\\r\\nliberty during the least valuable part of it, reminds me of the\\r\\nEnglishman who went to India to make a fortune first, in order that he\\r\\nmight return to England and live the life of a poet. He should have\\r\\ngone up garret at once. “What!” exclaim a million Irishmen starting up\\r\\nfrom all the shanties in the land, “is not this railroad which we have\\r\\nbuilt a good thing?” Yes, I answer, _comparatively_ good, that is, you\\r\\nmight have done worse; but I wish, as you are brothers of mine, that\\r\\nyou could have spent your time better than digging in this dirt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I finished my house, wishing to earn ten or twelve dollars by\\r\\nsome honest and agreeable method, in order to meet my unusual expenses,\\r\\nI planted about two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it\\r\\nchiefly with beans, but also a small part with potatoes, corn, peas,\\r\\nand turnips. The whole lot contains eleven acres, mostly growing up to\\r\\npines and hickories, and was sold the preceding season for eight\\r\\ndollars and eight cents an acre. One farmer said that it was “good for\\r\\nnothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on.” I put no manure whatever\\r\\non this land, not being the owner, but merely a squatter, and not\\r\\nexpecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite hoe it all\\r\\nonce. I got out several cords of stumps in ploughing, which supplied me\\r\\nwith fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould,\\r\\neasily distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of\\r\\nthe beans there. The dead and for the most part unmerchantable wood\\r\\nbehind my house, and the driftwood from the pond, have supplied the\\r\\nremainder of my fuel. I was obliged to hire a team and a man for the\\r\\nploughing, though I held the plough myself. My farm outgoes for the\\r\\nfirst season were, for implements, seed, work, &c., $14.72½. The seed\\r\\ncorn was given me. This never costs anything to speak of, unless you\\r\\nplant more than enough. I got twelve bushels of beans, and eighteen\\r\\nbushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn. The yellow corn\\r\\nand turnips were too late to come to any thing. My whole income from\\r\\nthe farm was\\r\\n\\r\\n                                       $ 23.44\\r\\n      Deducting the outgoes,...........  14.72½\\r\\n                                         ————\\r\\n      There are left,................. $  8.71½,\\r\\n\\r\\nbeside produce consumed and on hand at the time this estimate was made\\r\\nof the value of $4.50,—the amount on hand much more than balancing a\\r\\nlittle grass which I did not raise. All things considered, that is,\\r\\nconsidering the importance of a man’s soul and of to-day,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the short time occupied by my experiment, nay, partly\\r\\neven because of its transient character, I believe that that was doing\\r\\nbetter than any farmer in Concord did that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next year I did better still, for I spaded up all the land which I\\r\\nrequired, about a third of an acre, and I learned from the experience\\r\\nof both years, not being in the least awed by many celebrated works on\\r\\nhusbandry, Arthur Young among the rest, that if one would live simply\\r\\nand eat only the crop which he raised, and raise no more than he ate,\\r\\nand not exchange it for an insufficient quantity of more luxurious and\\r\\nexpensive things, he would need to cultivate only a few rods of ground,\\r\\nand that it would be cheaper to spade up that than to use oxen to\\r\\nplough it, and to select a fresh spot from time to time than to manure\\r\\nthe old, and he could do all his necessary farm work as it were with\\r\\nhis left hand at odd hours in the summer; and thus he would not be tied\\r\\nto an ox, or horse, or cow, or pig, as at present. I desire to speak\\r\\nimpartially on this point, and as one not interested in the success or\\r\\nfailure of the present economical and social arrangements. I was more\\r\\nindependent than any farmer in Concord, for I was not anchored to a\\r\\nhouse or farm, but could follow the bent of my genius, which is a very\\r\\ncrooked one, every moment. Beside being better off than they already,\\r\\nif my house had been burned or my crops had failed, I should have been\\r\\nnearly as well off as before.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds as\\r\\nherds are the keepers of men, the former are so much the freer. Men and\\r\\noxen exchange work; but if we consider necessary work only, the oxen\\r\\nwill be seen to have greatly the advantage, their farm is so much the\\r\\nlarger. Man does some of his part of the exchange work in his six weeks\\r\\nof haying, and it is no boy’s play. Certainly no nation that lived\\r\\nsimply in all respects, that is, no nation of philosophers, would\\r\\ncommit so great a blunder as to use the labor of animals. True, there\\r\\nnever was and is not likely soon to be a nation of philosophers, nor am\\r\\nI certain it is desirable that there should be. However, _I_ should\\r\\nnever have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any work\\r\\nhe might do for me, for fear I should become a horse-man or a herds-man\\r\\nmerely; and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are we\\r\\ncertain that what is one man’s gain is not another’s loss, and that the\\r\\nstable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied? Granted\\r\\nthat some public works would not have been constructed without this\\r\\naid, and let man share the glory of such with the ox and horse; does it\\r\\nfollow that he could not have accomplished works yet more worthy of\\r\\nhimself in that case? When men begin to do, not merely unnecessary or\\r\\nartistic, but luxurious and idle work, with their assistance, it is\\r\\ninevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the oxen, or, in\\r\\nother words, become the slaves of the strongest. Man thus not only\\r\\nworks for the animal within him, but, for a symbol of this, he works\\r\\nfor the animal without him. Though we have many substantial houses of\\r\\nbrick or stone, the prosperity of the farmer is still measured by the\\r\\ndegree to which the barn overshadows the house. This town is said to\\r\\nhave the largest houses for oxen, cows, and horses hereabouts, and it\\r\\nis not behindhand in its public buildings; but there are very few halls\\r\\nfor free worship or free speech in this county. It should not be by\\r\\ntheir architecture, but why not even by their power of abstract\\r\\nthought, that nations should seek to commemorate themselves? How much\\r\\nmore admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East! Towers\\r\\nand temples are the luxury of princes. A simple and independent mind\\r\\ndoes not toil at the bidding of any prince. Genius is not a retainer to\\r\\nany emperor, nor is its material silver, or gold, or marble, except to\\r\\na trifling extent. To what end, pray, is so much stone hammered? In\\r\\nArcadia, when I was there, I did not see any hammering stone. Nations\\r\\nare possessed with an insane ambition to perpetuate the memory of\\r\\nthemselves by the amount of hammered stone they leave. What if equal\\r\\npains were taken to smooth and polish their manners? One piece of good\\r\\nsense would be more memorable than a monument as high as the moon. I\\r\\nlove better to see stones in place. The grandeur of Thebes was a vulgar\\r\\ngrandeur. More sensible is a rod of stone wall that bounds an honest\\r\\nman’s field than a hundred-gated Thebes that has wandered farther from\\r\\nthe true end of life. The religion and civilization which are barbaric\\r\\nand heathenish build splendid temples; but what you might call\\r\\nChristianity does not. Most of the stone a nation hammers goes toward\\r\\nits tomb only. It buries itself alive. As for the Pyramids, there is\\r\\nnothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could\\r\\nbe found degraded enough to spend their lives constructing a tomb for\\r\\nsome ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have\\r\\ndrowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs. I might\\r\\npossibly invent some excuse for them and him, but I have no time for\\r\\nit. As for the religion and love of art of the builders, it is much the\\r\\nsame all the world over, whether the building be an Egyptian temple or\\r\\nthe United States Bank. It costs more than it comes to. The mainspring\\r\\nis vanity, assisted by the love of garlic and bread and butter. Mr.\\r\\nBalcom, a promising young architect, designs it on the back of his\\r\\nVitruvius, with hard pencil and ruler, and the job is let out to Dobson\\r\\n& Sons, stonecutters. When the thirty centuries begin to look down on\\r\\nit, mankind begin to look up at it. As for your high towers and\\r\\nmonuments, there was a crazy fellow once in this town who undertook to\\r\\ndig through to China, and he got so far that, as he said, he heard the\\r\\nChinese pots and kettles rattle; but I think that I shall not go out of\\r\\nmy way to admire the hole which he made. Many are concerned about the\\r\\nmonuments of the West and the East,—to know who built them. For my\\r\\npart, I should like to know who in those days did not build them,—who\\r\\nwere above such trifling. But to proceed with my statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy surveying, carpentry, and day-labor of various other kinds in the\\r\\nvillage in the mean while, for I have as many trades as fingers, I had\\r\\nearned $13.34. The expense of food for eight months, namely, from July\\r\\n4th to March 1st, the time when these estimates were made, though I\\r\\nlived there more than two years,—not counting potatoes, a little green\\r\\ncorn, and some peas, which I had raised, nor considering the value of\\r\\nwhat was on hand at the last date, was\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    Rice,................... $ 1.73½\\r\\n    Molasses,................  1.73     Cheapest form of the\\r\\n                                         saccharine.\\r\\n    Rye meal,................  1.04¾\\r\\n    Indian meal,.............  0.99¾     Cheaper than rye.\\r\\n    Pork,....................  0.22\\r\\n\\r\\n    All experiments which failed:\\r\\n    Flour,...................  0.88  Costs more than Indian meal,\\r\\n                                      both money and trouble.\\r\\n    Sugar,...................  0.80\\r\\n    Lard,....................  0.65\\r\\n    Apples,..................  0.25\\r\\n    Dried apple,.............  0.22\\r\\n    Sweet potatoes,..........  0.10\\r\\n    One pumpkin,.............  0.06\\r\\n    One watermelon,..........  0.02\\r\\n    Salt,....................  0.03\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, I did eat $8.74, all told; but I should not thus unblushingly\\r\\npublish my guilt, if I did not know that most of my readers were\\r\\nequally guilty with myself, and that their deeds would look no better\\r\\nin print. The next year I sometimes caught a mess of fish for my\\r\\ndinner, and once I went so far as to slaughter a woodchuck which\\r\\nravaged my bean-field,—effect his transmigration, as a Tartar would\\r\\nsay,—and devour him, partly for experiment’s sake; but though it\\r\\nafforded me a momentary enjoyment, notwithstanding a musky flavor, I\\r\\nsaw that the longest use would not make that a good practice, however\\r\\nit might seem to have your woodchucks ready dressed by the village\\r\\nbutcher.\\r\\n\\r\\nClothing and some incidental expenses within the same dates, though\\r\\nlittle can be inferred from this item, amounted to\\r\\n\\r\\n                                            $8.40¾\\r\\n    Oil and some household utensils,.......  2.00\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that all the pecuniary outgoes, excepting for washing and mending,\\r\\nwhich for the most part were done out of the house, and their bills\\r\\nhave not yet been received,—and these are all and more than all the\\r\\nways by which money necessarily goes out in this part of the\\r\\nworld,—were\\r\\n\\r\\n    House,................................ $ 28.12½\\r\\n    Farm one year,.......................... 14.72½\\r\\n    Food eight months,......................  8.74\\r\\n    Clothing, etc., eight months,...........  8.40¾\\r\\n    Oil, &c., eight months,.................  2.00\\r\\n                                           ——————\\r\\n        In all,........................... $ 61.99¾\\r\\n\\r\\nI address myself now to those of my readers who have a living to get.\\r\\nAnd to meet this I have for farm produce sold\\r\\n\\r\\n                                            $23.44\\r\\n    Earned by day-labor,...................  13.34\\r\\n                                           ——————\\r\\n        In all,............................ $36.78,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich subtracted from the sum of the outgoes leaves a balance of\\r\\n$25.21¾ on the one side,—this being very nearly the means with which I\\r\\nstarted, and the measure of expenses to be incurred,—and on the other,\\r\\nbeside the leisure and independence and health thus secured, a\\r\\ncomfortable house for me as long as I choose to occupy it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese statistics, however accidental and therefore uninstructive they\\r\\nmay appear, as they have a certain completeness, have a certain value\\r\\nalso. Nothing was given me of which I have not rendered some account.\\r\\nIt appears from the above estimate, that my food alone cost me in money\\r\\nabout twenty-seven cents a week. It was, for nearly two years after\\r\\nthis, rye and Indian meal without yeast, potatoes, rice, a very little\\r\\nsalt pork, molasses, and salt, and my drink water. It was fit that I\\r\\nshould live on rice, mainly, who loved so well the philosophy of India.\\r\\nTo meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers, I may as well\\r\\nstate, that if I dined out occasionally, as I always had done, and I\\r\\ntrust shall have opportunities to do again, it was frequently to the\\r\\ndetriment of my domestic arrangements. But the dining out, being, as I\\r\\nhave stated, a constant element, does not in the least affect a\\r\\ncomparative statement like this.\\r\\n\\r\\nI learned from my two years’ experience that it would cost incredibly\\r\\nlittle trouble to obtain one’s necessary food, even in this latitude;\\r\\nthat a man may use as simple a diet as the animals, and yet retain\\r\\nhealth and strength. I have made a satisfactory dinner, satisfactory on\\r\\nseveral accounts, simply off a dish of purslane (_Portulaca oleracea_)\\r\\nwhich I gathered in my cornfield, boiled and salted. I give the Latin\\r\\non account of the savoriness of the trivial name. And pray what more\\r\\ncan a reasonable man desire, in peaceful times, in ordinary noons, than\\r\\na sufficient number of ears of green sweet-corn boiled, with the\\r\\naddition of salt? Even the little variety which I used was a yielding\\r\\nto the demands of appetite, and not of health. Yet men have come to\\r\\nsuch a pass that they frequently starve, not for want of necessaries,\\r\\nbut for want of luxuries; and I know a good woman who thinks that her\\r\\nson lost his life because he took to drinking water only.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reader will perceive that I am treating the subject rather from an\\r\\neconomic than a dietetic point of view, and he will not venture to put\\r\\nmy abstemiousness to the test unless he has a well-stocked larder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBread I at first made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes,\\r\\nwhich I baked before my fire out of doors on a shingle or the end of a\\r\\nstick of timber sawed off in building my house; but it was wont to get\\r\\nsmoked and to have a piny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last\\r\\nfound a mixture of rye and Indian meal most convenient and agreeable.\\r\\nIn cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves\\r\\nof this in succession, tending and turning them as carefully as an\\r\\nEgyptian his hatching eggs. They were a real cereal fruit which I\\r\\nripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble\\r\\nfruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths.\\r\\nI made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making,\\r\\nconsulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive\\r\\ndays and first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness\\r\\nof nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this\\r\\ndiet, and travelling gradually down in my studies through that\\r\\naccidental souring of the dough which, it is supposed, taught the\\r\\nleavening process, and through the various fermentations thereafter,\\r\\ntill I came to “good, sweet, wholesome bread,” the staff of life.\\r\\nLeaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the _spiritus_ which fills\\r\\nits cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved like the vestal\\r\\nfire,—some precious bottle-full, I suppose, first brought over in the\\r\\nMayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still\\r\\nrising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land,—this\\r\\nseed I regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at\\r\\nlength one morning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which\\r\\naccident I discovered that even this was not indispensable,—for my\\r\\ndiscoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic process,—and I have\\r\\ngladly omitted it since, though most housewives earnestly assured me\\r\\nthat safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be, and elderly\\r\\npeople prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces. Yet I find it not\\r\\nto be an essential ingredient, and after going without it for a year am\\r\\nstill in the land of the living; and I am glad to escape the\\r\\ntrivialness of carrying a bottle-full in my pocket, which would\\r\\nsometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is\\r\\nsimpler and more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than\\r\\nany other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances. Neither\\r\\ndid I put any sal soda, or other acid or alkali, into my bread. It\\r\\nwould seem that I made it according to the recipe which Marcus Porcius\\r\\nCato gave about two centuries before Christ. “Panem depsticium sic\\r\\nfacito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in mortarium indito,\\r\\naquæ paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene subegeris,\\r\\ndefingito, coquitoque sub testu.” Which I take to mean—“Make kneaded\\r\\nbread thus. Wash your hands and trough well. Put the meal into the\\r\\ntrough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly. When you have\\r\\nkneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover,” that is, in a\\r\\nbaking-kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this\\r\\nstaff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw\\r\\nnone of it for more than a month.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery New Englander might easily raise all his own breadstuffs in this\\r\\nland of rye and Indian corn, and not depend on distant and fluctuating\\r\\nmarkets for them. Yet so far are we from simplicity and independence\\r\\nthat, in Concord, fresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops, and\\r\\nhominy and corn in a still coarser form are hardly used by any. For the\\r\\nmost part the farmer gives to his cattle and hogs the grain of his own\\r\\nproducing, and buys flour, which is at least no more wholesome, at a\\r\\ngreater cost, at the store. I saw that I could easily raise my bushel\\r\\nor two of rye and Indian corn, for the former will grow on the poorest\\r\\nland, and the latter does not require the best, and grind them in a\\r\\nhand-mill, and so do without rice and pork; and if I must have some\\r\\nconcentrated sweet, I found by experiment that I could make a very good\\r\\nmolasses either of pumpkins or beets, and I knew that I needed only to\\r\\nset out a few maples to obtain it more easily still, and while these\\r\\nwere growing I could use various substitutes beside those which I have\\r\\nnamed. “For,” as the Forefathers sang,—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “we can make liquor to sweeten our lips\\r\\n     Of pumpkins and parsnips and walnut-tree chips.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, as for salt, that grossest of groceries, to obtain this might\\r\\nbe a fit occasion for a visit to the seashore, or, if I did without it\\r\\naltogether, I should probably drink the less water. I do not learn that\\r\\nthe Indians ever troubled themselves to go after it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus I could avoid all trade and barter, so far as my food was\\r\\nconcerned, and having a shelter already, it would only remain to get\\r\\nclothing and fuel. The pantaloons which I now wear were woven in a\\r\\nfarmer’s family,—thank Heaven there is so much virtue still in man; for\\r\\nI think the fall from the farmer to the operative as great and\\r\\nmemorable as that from the man to the farmer;—and in a new country,\\r\\nfuel is an encumbrance. As for a habitat, if I were not permitted still\\r\\nto squat, I might purchase one acre at the same price for which the\\r\\nland I cultivated was sold—namely, eight dollars and eight cents. But\\r\\nas it was, I considered that I enhanced the value of the land by\\r\\nsquatting on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me such\\r\\nquestions as, if I think that I can live on vegetable food alone; and\\r\\nto strike at the root of the matter at once,—for the root is faith,—I\\r\\nam accustomed to answer such, that I can live on board nails. If they\\r\\ncannot understand that, they cannot understand much that I have to say.\\r\\nFor my part, I am glad to hear of experiments of this kind being tried;\\r\\nas that a young man tried for a fortnight to live on hard, raw corn on\\r\\nthe ear, using his teeth for all mortar. The squirrel tribe tried the\\r\\nsame and succeeded. The human race is interested in these experiments,\\r\\nthough a few old women who are incapacitated for them, or who own their\\r\\nthirds in mills, may be alarmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMy furniture, part of which I made myself, and the rest cost me nothing\\r\\nof which I have not rendered an account, consisted of a bed, a table, a\\r\\ndesk, three chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter, a pair of\\r\\ntongs and andirons, a kettle, a skillet, and a frying-pan, a dipper, a\\r\\nwash-bowl, two knives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a\\r\\njug for oil, a jug for molasses, and a japanned lamp. None is so poor\\r\\nthat he need sit on a pumpkin. That is shiftlessness. There is a plenty\\r\\nof such chairs as I like best in the village garrets to be had for\\r\\ntaking them away. Furniture! Thank God, I can sit and I can stand\\r\\nwithout the aid of a furniture warehouse. What man but a philosopher\\r\\nwould not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and going up\\r\\ncountry exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men, a beggarly\\r\\naccount of empty boxes? That is Spaulding’s furniture. I could never\\r\\ntell from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so called\\r\\nrich man or a poor one; the owner always seemed poverty-stricken.\\r\\nIndeed, the more you have of such things the poorer you are. Each load\\r\\nlooks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties; and if one\\r\\nshanty is poor, this is a dozen times as poor. Pray, for what do we\\r\\n_move_ ever but to get rid of our furniture, our _exuviæ_; at last to\\r\\ngo from this world to another newly furnished, and leave this to be\\r\\nburned? It is the same as if all these traps were buckled to a man’s\\r\\nbelt, and he could not move over the rough country where our lines are\\r\\ncast without dragging them,—dragging his trap. He was a lucky fox that\\r\\nleft his tail in the trap. The muskrat will gnaw his third leg off to\\r\\nbe free. No wonder man has lost his elasticity. How often he is at a\\r\\ndead set! “Sir, if I may be so bold, what do you mean by a dead set?”\\r\\nIf you are a seer, whenever you meet a man you will see all that he\\r\\nowns, ay, and much that he pretends to disown, behind him, even to his\\r\\nkitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not\\r\\nburn, and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway\\r\\nhe can. I think that the man is at a dead set who has got through a\\r\\nknot hole or gateway where his sledge load of furniture cannot follow\\r\\nhim. I cannot but feel compassion when I hear some trig,\\r\\ncompact-looking man, seemingly free, all girded and ready, speak of his\\r\\n“furniture,” as whether it is insured or not. “But what shall I do with\\r\\nmy furniture?” My gay butterfly is entangled in a spider’s web then.\\r\\nEven those who seem for a long while not to have any, if you inquire\\r\\nmore narrowly you will find have some stored in somebody’s barn. I look\\r\\nupon England to-day as an old gentleman who is travelling with a great\\r\\ndeal of baggage, trumpery which has accumulated from long housekeeping,\\r\\nwhich he has not the courage to burn; great trunk, little trunk,\\r\\nbandbox and bundle. Throw away the first three at least. It would\\r\\nsurpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk,\\r\\nand I should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run.\\r\\nWhen I have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained\\r\\nhis all—looking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of\\r\\nhis neck—I have pitied him, not because that was his all, but because\\r\\nhe had all _that_ to carry. If I have got to drag my trap, I will take\\r\\ncare that it be a light one and do not nip me in a vital part. But\\r\\nperchance it would be wisest never to put one’s paw into it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would observe, by the way, that it costs me nothing for curtains, for\\r\\nI have no gazers to shut out but the sun and moon, and I am willing\\r\\nthat they should look in. The moon will not sour milk nor taint meat of\\r\\nmine, nor will the sun injure my furniture or fade my carpet, and if he\\r\\nis sometimes too warm a friend, I find it still better economy to\\r\\nretreat behind some curtain which nature has provided, than to add a\\r\\nsingle item to the details of housekeeping. A lady once offered me a\\r\\nmat, but as I had no room to spare within the house, nor time to spare\\r\\nwithin or without to shake it, I declined it, preferring to wipe my\\r\\nfeet on the sod before my door. It is best to avoid the beginnings of\\r\\nevil.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot long since I was present at the auction of a deacon’s effects, for\\r\\nhis life had not been ineffectual:—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “The evil that men do lives after them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs usual, a great proportion was trumpery which had begun to accumulate\\r\\nin his father’s day. Among the rest was a dried tapeworm. And now,\\r\\nafter lying half a century in his garret and other dust holes, these\\r\\nthings were not burned; instead of a _bonfire_, or purifying\\r\\ndestruction of them, there was an _auction_, or increasing of them. The\\r\\nneighbors eagerly collected to view them, bought them all, and\\r\\ncarefully transported them to their garrets and dust holes, to lie\\r\\nthere till their estates are settled, when they will start again. When\\r\\na man dies he kicks the dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe customs of some savage nations might, perchance, be profitably\\r\\nimitated by us, for they at least go through the semblance of casting\\r\\ntheir slough annually; they have the idea of the thing, whether they\\r\\nhave the reality or not. Would it not be well if we were to celebrate\\r\\nsuch a “busk,” or “feast of first fruits,” as Bartram describes to have\\r\\nbeen the custom of the Mucclasse Indians? “When a town celebrates the\\r\\nbusk,” says he, “having previously provided themselves with new\\r\\nclothes, new pots, pans, and other household utensils and furniture,\\r\\nthey collect all their worn out clothes and other despicable things,\\r\\nsweep and cleanse their houses, squares, and the whole town of their\\r\\nfilth, which with all the remaining grain and other old provisions they\\r\\ncast together into one common heap, and consume it with fire. After\\r\\nhaving taken medicine, and fasted for three days, all the fire in the\\r\\ntown is extinguished. During this fast they abstain from the\\r\\ngratification of every appetite and passion whatever. A general amnesty\\r\\nis proclaimed; all malefactors may return to their town.—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the fourth morning, the high priest, by rubbing dry wood together,\\r\\nproduces new fire in the public square, from whence every habitation in\\r\\nthe town is supplied with the new and pure flame.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey then feast on the new corn and fruits, and dance and sing for\\r\\nthree days, “and the four following days they receive visits and\\r\\nrejoice with their friends from neighboring towns who have in like\\r\\nmanner purified and prepared themselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexicans also practised a similar purification at the end of every\\r\\nfifty-two years, in the belief that it was time for the world to come\\r\\nto an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have scarcely heard of a truer sacrament, that is, as the dictionary\\r\\ndefines it, “outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual\\r\\ngrace,” than this, and I have no doubt that they were originally\\r\\ninspired directly from Heaven to do thus, though they have no biblical\\r\\nrecord of the revelation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor\\r\\nof my hands, and I found, that by working about six weeks in a year, I\\r\\ncould meet all the expenses of living. The whole of my winters, as well\\r\\nas most of my summers, I had free and clear for study. I have\\r\\nthoroughly tried school-keeping, and found that my expenses were in\\r\\nproportion, or rather out of proportion, to my income, for I was\\r\\nobliged to dress and train, not to say think and believe, accordingly,\\r\\nand I lost my time into the bargain. As I did not teach for the good of\\r\\nmy fellow-men, but simply for a livelihood, this was a failure. I have\\r\\ntried trade; but I found that it would take ten years to get under way\\r\\nin that, and that then I should probably be on my way to the devil. I\\r\\nwas actually afraid that I might by that time be doing what is called a\\r\\ngood business. When formerly I was looking about to see what I could do\\r\\nfor a living, some sad experience in conforming to the wishes of\\r\\nfriends being fresh in my mind to tax my ingenuity, I thought often and\\r\\nseriously of picking huckleberries; that surely I could do, and its\\r\\nsmall profits might suffice,—for my greatest skill has been to want but\\r\\nlittle,—so little capital it required, so little distraction from my\\r\\nwonted moods, I foolishly thought. While my acquaintances went\\r\\nunhesitatingly into trade or the professions, I contemplated this\\r\\noccupation as most like theirs; ranging the hills all summer to pick\\r\\nthe berries which came in my way, and thereafter carelessly dispose of\\r\\nthem; so, to keep the flocks of Admetus. I also dreamed that I might\\r\\ngather the wild herbs, or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved\\r\\nto be reminded of the woods, even to the city, by hay-cart loads. But I\\r\\nhave since learned that trade curses everything it handles; and though\\r\\nyou trade in messages from heaven, the whole curse of trade attaches to\\r\\nthe business.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I preferred some things to others, and especially valued my freedom,\\r\\nas I could fare hard and yet succeed well, I did not wish to spend my\\r\\ntime in earning rich carpets or other fine furniture, or delicate\\r\\ncookery, or a house in the Grecian or the Gothic style just yet. If\\r\\nthere are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these things,\\r\\nand who know how to use them when acquired, I relinquish to them the\\r\\npursuit. Some are “industrious,” and appear to love labor for its own\\r\\nsake, or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief; to such I\\r\\nhave at present nothing to say. Those who would not know what to do\\r\\nwith more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to work twice as\\r\\nhard as they do,—work till they pay for themselves, and get their free\\r\\npapers. For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was the\\r\\nmost independent of any, especially as it required only thirty or forty\\r\\ndays in a year to support one. The laborer’s day ends with the going\\r\\ndown of the sun, and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen\\r\\npursuit, independent of his labor; but his employer, who speculates\\r\\nfrom month to month, has no respite from one end of the year to the\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to\\r\\nmaintain one’s self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if\\r\\nwe will live simply and wisely; as the pursuits of the simpler nations\\r\\nare still the sports of the more artificial. It is not necessary that a\\r\\nman should earn his living by the sweat of his brow, unless he sweats\\r\\neasier than I do.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne young man of my acquaintance, who has inherited some acres, told me\\r\\nthat he thought he should live as I did, _if he had the means_. I would\\r\\nnot have any one adopt _my_ mode of living on any account; for, beside\\r\\nthat before he has fairly learned it I may have found out another for\\r\\nmyself, I desire that there may be as many different persons in the\\r\\nworld as possible; but I would have each one be very careful to find\\r\\nout and pursue _his own_ way, and not his father’s or his mother’s or\\r\\nhis neighbor’s instead. The youth may build or plant or sail, only let\\r\\nhim not be hindered from doing that which he tells me he would like to\\r\\ndo. It is by a mathematical point only that we are wise, as the sailor\\r\\nor the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his eye; but that is\\r\\nsufficient guidance for all our life. We may not arrive at our port\\r\\nwithin a calculable period, but we would preserve the true course.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndoubtedly, in this case, what is true for one is truer still for a\\r\\nthousand, as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a\\r\\nsmall one, since one roof may cover, one cellar underlie, and one wall\\r\\nseparate several apartments. But for my part, I preferred the solitary\\r\\ndwelling. Moreover, it will commonly be cheaper to build the whole\\r\\nyourself than to convince another of the advantage of the common wall;\\r\\nand when you have done this, the common partition, to be much cheaper,\\r\\nmust be a thin one, and that other may prove a bad neighbor, and also\\r\\nnot keep his side in repair. The only coöperation which is commonly\\r\\npossible is exceedingly partial and superficial; and what little true\\r\\ncoöperation there is, is as if it were not, being a harmony inaudible\\r\\nto men. If a man has faith, he will coöperate with equal faith\\r\\neverywhere; if he has not faith, he will continue to live like the rest\\r\\nof the world, whatever company he is joined to. To coöperate, in the\\r\\nhighest as well as the lowest sense, means _to get our living\\r\\ntogether_. I heard it proposed lately that two young men should travel\\r\\ntogether over the world, the one without money, earning his means as he\\r\\nwent, before the mast and behind the plow, the other carrying a bill of\\r\\nexchange in his pocket. It was easy to see that they could not long be\\r\\ncompanions or coöperate, since one would not _operate_ at all. They\\r\\nwould part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures. Above\\r\\nall, as I have implied, the man who goes alone can start to-day; but he\\r\\nwho travels with another must wait till that other is ready, and it may\\r\\nbe a long time before they get off.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all this is very selfish, I have heard some of my townsmen say. I\\r\\nconfess that I have hitherto indulged very little in philanthropic\\r\\nenterprises. I have made some sacrifices to a sense of duty, and among\\r\\nothers have sacrificed this pleasure also. There are those who have\\r\\nused all their arts to persuade me to undertake the support of some\\r\\npoor family in the town; and if I had nothing to do,—for the devil\\r\\nfinds employment for the idle,—I might try my hand at some such pastime\\r\\nas that. However, when I have thought to indulge myself in this\\r\\nrespect, and lay their Heaven under an obligation by maintaining\\r\\ncertain poor persons in all respects as comfortably as I maintain\\r\\nmyself, and have even ventured so far as to make them the offer, they\\r\\nhave one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain poor. While my\\r\\ntownsmen and women are devoted in so many ways to the good of their\\r\\nfellows, I trust that one at least may be spared to other and less\\r\\nhumane pursuits. You must have a genius for charity as well as for any\\r\\nthing else. As for Doing-good, that is one of the professions which are\\r\\nfull. Moreover, I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am\\r\\nsatisfied that it does not agree with my constitution. Probably I\\r\\nshould not consciously and deliberately forsake my particular calling\\r\\nto do the good which society demands of me, to save the universe from\\r\\nannihilation; and I believe that a like but infinitely greater\\r\\nsteadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it. But I would not\\r\\nstand between any man and his genius; and to him who does this work,\\r\\nwhich I decline, with his whole heart and soul and life, I would say,\\r\\nPersevere, even if the world call it doing evil, as it is most likely\\r\\nthey will.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am far from supposing that my case is a peculiar one; no doubt many\\r\\nof my readers would make a similar defence. At doing something,—I will\\r\\nnot engage that my neighbors shall pronounce it good,—I do not hesitate\\r\\nto say that I should be a capital fellow to hire; but what that is, it\\r\\nis for my employer to find out. What _good_ I do, in the common sense\\r\\nof that word, must be aside from my main path, and for the most part\\r\\nwholly unintended. Men say, practically, Begin where you are and such\\r\\nas you are, without aiming mainly to become of more worth, and with\\r\\nkindness aforethought go about doing good. If I were to preach at all\\r\\nin this strain, I should say rather, Set about being good. As if the\\r\\nsun should stop when he had kindled his fires up to the splendor of a\\r\\nmoon or a star of the sixth magnitude, and go about like a Robin\\r\\nGoodfellow, peeping in at every cottage window, inspiring lunatics, and\\r\\ntainting meats, and making darkness visible, instead of steadily\\r\\nincreasing his genial heat and beneficence till he is of such\\r\\nbrightness that no mortal can look him in the face, and then, and in\\r\\nthe mean while too, going about the world in his own orbit, doing it\\r\\ngood, or rather, as a truer philosophy has discovered, the world going\\r\\nabout him getting good. When Phaeton, wishing to prove his heavenly\\r\\nbirth by his beneficence, had the sun’s chariot but one day, and drove\\r\\nout of the beaten track, he burned several blocks of houses in the\\r\\nlower streets of heaven, and scorched the surface of the earth, and\\r\\ndried up every spring, and made the great desert of Sahara, till at\\r\\nlength Jupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt, and\\r\\nthe sun, through grief at his death, did not shine for a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted. It\\r\\nis human, it is divine, carrion. If I knew for a certainty that a man\\r\\nwas coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I\\r\\nshould run for my life, as from that dry and parching wind of the\\r\\nAfrican deserts called the simoom, which fills the mouth and nose and\\r\\nears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated, for fear that I should\\r\\nget some of his good done to me,—some of its virus mingled with my\\r\\nblood. No,—in this case I would rather suffer evil the natural way. A\\r\\nman is not a good _man_ to me because he will feed me if I should be\\r\\nstarving, or warm me if I should be freezing, or pull me out of a ditch\\r\\nif I should ever fall into one. I can find you a Newfoundland dog that\\r\\nwill do as much. Philanthropy is not love for one’s fellow-man in the\\r\\nbroadest sense. Howard was no doubt an exceedingly kind and worthy man\\r\\nin his way, and has his reward; but, comparatively speaking, what are a\\r\\nhundred Howards to _us_, if their philanthropy do not help _us_ in our\\r\\nbest estate, when we are most worthy to be helped? I never heard of a\\r\\nphilanthropic meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any good\\r\\nto me, or the like of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jesuits were quite balked by those Indians who, being burned at the\\r\\nstake, suggested new modes of torture to their tormentors. Being\\r\\nsuperior to physical suffering, it sometimes chanced that they were\\r\\nsuperior to any consolation which the missionaries could offer; and the\\r\\nlaw to do as you would be done by fell with less persuasiveness on the\\r\\nears of those who, for their part, did not care how they were done by,\\r\\nwho loved their enemies after a new fashion, and came very near freely\\r\\nforgiving them all they did.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe sure that you give the poor the aid they most need, though it be\\r\\nyour example which leaves them far behind. If you give money, spend\\r\\nyourself with it, and do not merely abandon it to them. We make curious\\r\\nmistakes sometimes. Often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he\\r\\nis dirty and ragged and gross. It is partly his taste, and not merely\\r\\nhis misfortune. If you give him money, he will perhaps buy more rags\\r\\nwith it. I was wont to pity the clumsy Irish laborers who cut ice on\\r\\nthe pond, in such mean and ragged clothes, while I shivered in my more\\r\\ntidy and somewhat more fashionable garments, till, one bitter cold day,\\r\\none who had slipped into the water came to my house to warm him, and I\\r\\nsaw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of stockings ere\\r\\nhe got down to the skin, though they were dirty and ragged enough, it\\r\\nis true, and that he could afford to refuse the _extra_ garments which\\r\\nI offered him, he had so many _intra_ ones. This ducking was the very\\r\\nthing he needed. Then I began to pity myself, and I saw that it would\\r\\nbe a greater charity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole\\r\\nslop-shop on him. There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil\\r\\nto one who is striking at the root, and it may be that he who bestows\\r\\nthe largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most by\\r\\nhis mode of life to produce that misery which he strives in vain to\\r\\nrelieve. It is the pious slave-breeder devoting the proceeds of every\\r\\ntenth slave to buy a Sunday’s liberty for the rest. Some show their\\r\\nkindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens. Would they\\r\\nnot be kinder if they employed themselves there? You boast of spending\\r\\na tenth part of your income in charity; maybe you should spend the nine\\r\\ntenths so, and done with it. Society recovers only a tenth part of the\\r\\nproperty then. Is this owing to the generosity of him in whose\\r\\npossession it is found, or to the remissness of the officers of\\r\\njustice?\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently\\r\\nappreciated by mankind. Nay, it is greatly overrated; and it is our\\r\\nselfishness which overrates it. A robust poor man, one sunny day here\\r\\nin Concord, praised a fellow-townsman to me, because, as he said, he\\r\\nwas kind to the poor; meaning himself. The kind uncles and aunts of the\\r\\nrace are more esteemed than its true spiritual fathers and mothers. I\\r\\nonce heard a reverend lecturer on England, a man of learning and\\r\\nintelligence, after enumerating her scientific, literary, and political\\r\\nworthies, Shakespeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, Newton, and others,\\r\\nspeak next of her Christian heroes, whom, as if his profession required\\r\\nit of him, he elevated to a place far above all the rest, as the\\r\\ngreatest of the great. They were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry. Every one\\r\\nmust feel the falsehood and cant of this. The last were not England’s\\r\\nbest men and women; only, perhaps, her best philanthropists.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would not subtract any thing from the praise that is due to\\r\\nphilanthropy, but merely demand justice for all who by their lives and\\r\\nworks are a blessing to mankind. I do not value chiefly a man’s\\r\\nuprightness and benevolence, which are, as it were, his stem and\\r\\nleaves. Those plants of whose greenness withered we make herb tea for\\r\\nthe sick, serve but a humble use, and are most employed by quacks. I\\r\\nwant the flower and fruit of a man; that some fragrance be wafted over\\r\\nfrom him to me, and some ripeness flavor our intercourse. His goodness\\r\\nmust not be a partial and transitory act, but a constant superfluity,\\r\\nwhich costs him nothing and of which he is unconscious. This is a\\r\\ncharity that hides a multitude of sins. The philanthropist too often\\r\\nsurrounds mankind with the remembrance of his own cast-off griefs as an\\r\\natmosphere, and calls it sympathy. We should impart our courage, and\\r\\nnot our despair, our health and ease, and not our disease, and take\\r\\ncare that this does not spread by contagion. From what southern plains\\r\\ncomes up the voice of wailing? Under what latitudes reside the heathen\\r\\nto whom we would send light? Who is that intemperate and brutal man\\r\\nwhom we would redeem? If any thing ail a man, so that he does not\\r\\nperform his functions, if he have a pain in his bowels even,—for that\\r\\nis the seat of sympathy,—he forthwith sets about reforming—the world.\\r\\nBeing a microcosm himself, he discovers, and it is a true discovery,\\r\\nand he is the man to make it,—that the world has been eating green\\r\\napples; to his eyes, in fact, the globe itself is a great green apple,\\r\\nwhich there is danger awful to think of that the children of men will\\r\\nnibble before it is ripe; and straightway his drastic philanthropy\\r\\nseeks out the Esquimaux and the Patagonian, and embraces the populous\\r\\nIndian and Chinese villages; and thus, by a few years of philanthropic\\r\\nactivity, the powers in the mean while using him for their own ends, no\\r\\ndoubt, he cures himself of his dyspepsia, the globe acquires a faint\\r\\nblush on one or both of its cheeks, as if it were beginning to be ripe,\\r\\nand life loses its crudity and is once more sweet and wholesome to\\r\\nlive. I never dreamed of any enormity greater than I have committed. I\\r\\nnever knew, and never shall know, a worse man than myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that what so saddens the reformer is not his sympathy with\\r\\nhis fellows in distress, but, though he be the holiest son of God, is\\r\\nhis private ail. Let this be righted, let the spring come to him, the\\r\\nmorning rise over his couch, and he will forsake his generous\\r\\ncompanions without apology. My excuse for not lecturing against the use\\r\\nof tobacco is, that I never chewed it; that is a penalty which reformed\\r\\ntobacco-chewers have to pay; though there are things enough I have\\r\\nchewed, which I could lecture against. If you should ever be betrayed\\r\\ninto any of these philanthropies, do not let your left hand know what\\r\\nyour right hand does, for it is not worth knowing. Rescue the drowning\\r\\nand tie your shoe-strings. Take your time, and set about some free\\r\\nlabor.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur manners have been corrupted by communication with the saints. Our\\r\\nhymn-books resound with a melodious cursing of God and enduring him\\r\\nforever. One would say that even the prophets and redeemers had rather\\r\\nconsoled the fears than confirmed the hopes of man. There is nowhere\\r\\nrecorded a simple and irrepressible satisfaction with the gift of life,\\r\\nany memorable praise of God. All health and success does me good,\\r\\nhowever far off and withdrawn it may appear; all disease and failure\\r\\nhelps to make me sad and does me evil, however much sympathy it may\\r\\nhave with me or I with it. If, then, we would indeed restore mankind by\\r\\ntruly Indian, botanic, magnetic, or natural means, let us first be as\\r\\nsimple and well as Nature ourselves, dispel the clouds which hang over\\r\\nour own brows, and take up a little life into our pores. Do not stay to\\r\\nbe an overseer of the poor, but endeavor to become one of the worthies\\r\\nof the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nI read in the Gulistan, or Flower Garden, of Sheik Sadi of Shiraz, that\\r\\n“They asked a wise man, saying; Of the many celebrated trees which the\\r\\nMost High God has created lofty and umbrageous, they call none azad, or\\r\\nfree, excepting the cypress, which bears no fruit; what mystery is\\r\\nthere in this? He replied; Each has its appropriate produce, and\\r\\nappointed season, during the continuance of which it is fresh and\\r\\nblooming, and during their absence dry and withered; to neither of\\r\\nwhich states is the cypress exposed, being always flourishing; and of\\r\\nthis nature are the azads, or religious independents.—Fix not thy heart\\r\\non that which is transitory; for the Dijlah, or Tigris, will continue\\r\\nto flow through Bagdad after the race of caliphs is extinct: if thy\\r\\nhand has plenty, be liberal as the date tree; but if it affords nothing\\r\\nto give away, be an azad, or free man, like the cypress.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     COMPLEMENTAL VERSES\\r\\n\\r\\n     The Pretensions of Poverty\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Thou dost presume too much, poor needy wretch,\\r\\n     To claim a station in the firmament\\r\\n     Because thy humble cottage, or thy tub,\\r\\n     Nurses some lazy or pedantic virtue\\r\\n     In the cheap sunshine or by shady springs,\\r\\n     With roots and pot-herbs; where thy right hand,\\r\\n     Tearing those humane passions from the mind,\\r\\n     Upon whose stocks fair blooming virtues flourish,\\r\\n     Degradeth nature, and benumbeth sense,\\r\\n     And, Gorgon-like, turns active men to stone.\\r\\n     We not require the dull society\\r\\n     Of your necessitated temperance,\\r\\n     Or that unnatural stupidity\\r\\n     That knows nor joy nor sorrow; nor your forc’d\\r\\n     Falsely exalted passive fortitude\\r\\n     Above the active.

CAREW\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere I Lived, and What I Lived For\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every\\r\\nspot as the possible site of a house. I have thus surveyed the country\\r\\non every side within a dozen miles of where I live. In imagination I\\r\\nhave bought all the farms in succession, for all were to be bought, and\\r\\nI knew their price. I walked over each farmer’s premises, tasted his\\r\\nwild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his\\r\\nprice, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher\\r\\nprice on it,—took everything but a deed of it,—took his word for his\\r\\ndeed, for I dearly love to talk,—cultivated it, and him too to some\\r\\nextent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough,\\r\\nleaving him to carry it on. This experience entitled me to be regarded\\r\\nas a sort of real-estate broker by my friends. Wherever I sat, there I\\r\\nmight live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly. What is a\\r\\nhouse but a _sedes_, a seat?—better if a country seat. I discovered\\r\\nmany a site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some\\r\\nmight have thought too far from the village, but to my eyes the village\\r\\nwas too far from it. Well, there I might live, I said; and there I did\\r\\nlive, for an hour, a summer and a winter life; saw how I could let the\\r\\nyears run off, buffet the winter through, and see the spring come in.\\r\\nThe future inhabitants of this region, wherever they may place their\\r\\nhouses, may be sure that they have been anticipated. An afternoon\\r\\nsufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and to\\r\\ndecide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door,\\r\\nand whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and\\r\\nthen I let it lie, fallow perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to\\r\\nthe number of things which he can afford to let alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several\\r\\nfarms,—the refusal was all I wanted,—but I never got my fingers burned\\r\\nby actual possession. The nearest that I came to actual possession was\\r\\nwhen I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and\\r\\ncollected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or\\r\\noff with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife—every man\\r\\nhas such a wife—changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered\\r\\nme ten dollars to release him. Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten\\r\\ncents in the world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was\\r\\nthat man who had ten cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all\\r\\ntogether. However, I let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for\\r\\nI had carried it far enough; or rather, to be generous, I sold him the\\r\\nfarm for just what I gave for it, and, as he was not a rich man, made\\r\\nhim a present of ten dollars, and still had my ten cents, and seeds,\\r\\nand materials for a wheelbarrow left. I found thus that I had been a\\r\\nrich man without any damage to my poverty. But I retained the\\r\\nlandscape, and I have since annually carried off what it yielded\\r\\nwithout a wheelbarrow. With respect to landscapes,—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “I am monarch of all I _survey_,\\r\\n     My right there is none to dispute.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most\\r\\nvaluable part of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had\\r\\ngot a few wild apples only. Why, the owner does not know it for many\\r\\nyears when a poet has put his farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of\\r\\ninvisible fence, has fairly impounded it, milked it, skimmed it, and\\r\\ngot all the cream, and left the farmer only the skimmed milk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were; its complete\\r\\nretirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from\\r\\nthe nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field;\\r\\nits bounding on the river, which the owner said protected it by its\\r\\nfogs from frosts in the spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray\\r\\ncolor and ruinous state of the house and barn, and the dilapidated\\r\\nfences, which put such an interval between me and the last occupant;\\r\\nthe hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by rabbits, showing\\r\\nwhat kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the recollection I\\r\\nhad of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house was\\r\\nconcealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the\\r\\nhouse-dog bark. I was in haste to buy it, before the proprietor\\r\\nfinished getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees,\\r\\nand grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture,\\r\\nor, in short, had made any more of his improvements. To enjoy these\\r\\nadvantages I was ready to carry it on; like Atlas, to take the world on\\r\\nmy shoulders,—I never heard what compensation he received for that,—and\\r\\ndo all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that I\\r\\nmight pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it; for I knew\\r\\nall the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind I\\r\\nwanted if I could only afford to let it alone. But it turned out as I\\r\\nhave said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale,\\r\\n(I have always cultivated a garden,) was, that I had had my seeds\\r\\nready. Many think that seeds improve with age. I have no doubt that\\r\\ntime discriminates between the good and the bad; and when at last I\\r\\nshall plant, I shall be less likely to be disappointed. But I would say\\r\\nto my fellows, once for all, As long as possible live free and\\r\\nuncommitted. It makes but little difference whether you are committed\\r\\nto a farm or the county jail.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld Cato, whose “De Re Rusticâ” is my “Cultivator,” says, and the only\\r\\ntranslation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passage, “When you\\r\\nthink of getting a farm, turn it thus in your mind, not to buy\\r\\ngreedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think it\\r\\nenough to go round it once. The oftener you go there the more it will\\r\\nplease you, if it is good.” I think I shall not buy greedily, but go\\r\\nround and round it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that\\r\\nit may please me the more at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present was my next experiment of this kind, which I purpose to\\r\\ndescribe more at length; for convenience, putting the experience of two\\r\\nyears into one. As I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to\\r\\ndejection, but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning,\\r\\nstanding on his roost, if only to wake my neighbors up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my\\r\\nnights as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence\\r\\nDay, or the Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter,\\r\\nbut was merely a defence against the rain, without plastering or\\r\\nchimney, the walls being of rough, weather-stained boards, with wide\\r\\nchinks, which made it cool at night. The upright white hewn studs and\\r\\nfreshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look,\\r\\nespecially in the morning, when its timbers were saturated with dew, so\\r\\nthat I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them. To my\\r\\nimagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral\\r\\ncharacter, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I had\\r\\nvisited the year before. This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to\\r\\nentertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her\\r\\ngarments. The winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep\\r\\nover the ridges of mountains, bearing the broken strains, or celestial\\r\\nparts only, of terrestrial music. The morning wind forever blows, the\\r\\npoem of creation is uninterrupted; but few are the ears that hear it.\\r\\nOlympus is but the outside of the earth every where.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was\\r\\na tent, which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer,\\r\\nand this is still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing\\r\\nfrom hand to hand, has gone down the stream of time. With this more\\r\\nsubstantial shelter about me, I had made some progress toward settling\\r\\nin the world. This frame, so slightly clad, was a sort of\\r\\ncrystallization around me, and reacted on the builder. It was\\r\\nsuggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines. I did not need to go\\r\\noutdoors to take the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of\\r\\nits freshness. It was not so much within doors as behind a door where I\\r\\nsat, even in the rainiest weather. The Harivansa says, “An abode\\r\\nwithout birds is like a meat without seasoning.” Such was not my abode,\\r\\nfor I found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds; not by having\\r\\nimprisoned one, but having caged myself near them. I was not only\\r\\nnearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the\\r\\norchard, but to those wilder and more thrilling songsters of the forest\\r\\nwhich never, or rarely, serenade a villager,—the wood-thrush, the\\r\\nveery, the scarlet tanager, the field-sparrow, the whippoorwill, and\\r\\nmany others.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half\\r\\nsouth of the village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the\\r\\nmidst of an extensive wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two\\r\\nmiles south of that our only field known to fame, Concord Battle\\r\\nGround; but I was so low in the woods that the opposite shore, half a\\r\\nmile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my most distant\\r\\nhorizon. For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it\\r\\nimpressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom\\r\\nfar above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it\\r\\nthrowing off its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by\\r\\ndegrees, its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was\\r\\nrevealed, while the mists, like ghosts, were stealthily withdrawing in\\r\\nevery direction into the woods, as at the breaking up of some nocturnal\\r\\nconventicle. The very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the\\r\\nday than usual, as on the sides of mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a\\r\\ngentle rain storm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly\\r\\nstill, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of\\r\\nevening, and the wood-thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to\\r\\nshore. A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the\\r\\nclear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds,\\r\\nthe water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself\\r\\nso much the more important. From a hill top near by, where the wood had\\r\\nbeen recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the\\r\\npond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore\\r\\nthere, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a\\r\\nstream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but\\r\\nstream there was none. That way I looked between and over the near\\r\\ngreen hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with\\r\\nblue. Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of\\r\\nthe peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the\\r\\nnorth-west, those true-blue coins from heaven’s own mint, and also of\\r\\nsome portion of the village. But in other directions, even from this\\r\\npoint, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me. It\\r\\nis well to have some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to\\r\\nand float the earth. One value even of the smallest well is, that when\\r\\nyou look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular. This\\r\\nis as important as that it keeps butter cool. When I looked across the\\r\\npond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood\\r\\nI distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley,\\r\\nlike a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a\\r\\nthin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of\\r\\ninterverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was\\r\\nbut _dry land_.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the view from my door was still more contracted, I did not feel\\r\\ncrowded or confined in the least. There was pasture enough for my\\r\\nimagination. The low shrub-oak plateau to which the opposite shore\\r\\narose, stretched away toward the prairies of the West and the steppes\\r\\nof Tartary, affording ample room for all the roving families of men.\\r\\n“There are none happy in the world but beings who enjoy freely a vast\\r\\nhorizon,”—said Damodara, when his herds required new and larger\\r\\npastures.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth place and time were changed, and I dwelt nearer to those parts of\\r\\nthe universe and to those eras in history which had most attracted me.\\r\\nWhere I lived was as far off as many a region viewed nightly by\\r\\nastronomers. We are wont to imagine rare and delectable places in some\\r\\nremote and more celestial corner of the system, behind the\\r\\nconstellation of Cassiopeia’s Chair, far from noise and disturbance. I\\r\\ndiscovered that my house actually had its site in such a withdrawn, but\\r\\nforever new and unprofaned, part of the universe. If it were worth the\\r\\nwhile to settle in those parts near to the Pleiades or the Hyades, to\\r\\nAldebaran or Altair, then I was really there, or at an equal remoteness\\r\\nfrom the life which I had left behind, dwindled and twinkling with as\\r\\nfine a ray to my nearest neighbor, and to be seen only in moonless\\r\\nnights by him. Such was that part of creation where I had squatted;—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “There was a shepherd that did live,\\r\\n         And held his thoughts as high\\r\\n     As were the mounts whereon his flocks\\r\\n         Did hourly feed him by.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat should we think of the shepherd’s life if his flocks always\\r\\nwandered to higher pastures than his thoughts?\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal\\r\\nsimplicity, and I may say innocence, with Nature herself. I have been\\r\\nas sincere a worshipper of Aurora as the Greeks. I got up early and\\r\\nbathed in the pond; that was a religious exercise, and one of the best\\r\\nthings which I did. They say that characters were engraven on the\\r\\nbathing tub of king Tching-thang to this effect: “Renew thyself\\r\\ncompletely each day; do it again, and again, and forever again.” I can\\r\\nunderstand that. Morning brings back the heroic ages. I was as much\\r\\naffected by the faint hum of a mosquito making its invisible and\\r\\nunimaginable tour through my apartment at earliest dawn, when I was\\r\\nsitting with door and windows open, as I could be by any trumpet that\\r\\never sang of fame. It was Homer’s requiem; itself an Iliad and Odyssey\\r\\nin the air, singing its own wrath and wanderings. There was something\\r\\ncosmical about it; a standing advertisement, till forbidden, of the\\r\\neverlasting vigor and fertility of the world. The morning, which is the\\r\\nmost memorable season of the day, is the awakening hour. Then there is\\r\\nleast somnolence in us; and for an hour, at least, some part of us\\r\\nawakes which slumbers all the rest of the day and night. Little is to\\r\\nbe expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not\\r\\nawakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some\\r\\nservitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and\\r\\naspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial\\r\\nmusic, instead of factory bells, and a fragrance filling the air—to a\\r\\nhigher life than we fell asleep from; and thus the darkness bear its\\r\\nfruit, and prove itself to be good, no less than the light. That man\\r\\nwho does not believe that each day contains an earlier, more sacred,\\r\\nand auroral hour than he has yet profaned, has despaired of life, and\\r\\nis pursuing a descending and darkening way. After a partial cessation\\r\\nof his sensuous life, the soul of man, or its organs rather, are\\r\\nreinvigorated each day, and his Genius tries again what noble life it\\r\\ncan make. All memorable events, I should say, transpire in morning time\\r\\nand in a morning atmosphere. The Vedas say, “All intelligences awake\\r\\nwith the morning.” Poetry and art, and the fairest and most memorable\\r\\nof the actions of men, date from such an hour. All poets and heroes,\\r\\nlike Memnon, are the children of Aurora, and emit their music at\\r\\nsunrise. To him whose elastic and vigorous thought keeps pace with the\\r\\nsun, the day is a perpetual morning. It matters not what the clocks say\\r\\nor the attitudes and labors of men. Morning is when I am awake and\\r\\nthere is a dawn in me. Moral reform is the effort to throw off sleep.\\r\\nWhy is it that men give so poor an account of their day if they have\\r\\nnot been slumbering? They are not such poor calculators. If they had\\r\\nnot been overcome with drowsiness, they would have performed something.\\r\\nThe millions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a\\r\\nmillion is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one\\r\\nin a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be\\r\\nalive. I have never yet met a man who was quite awake. How could I have\\r\\nlooked him in the face?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical\\r\\naids, but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not\\r\\nforsake us in our soundest sleep. I know of no more encouraging fact\\r\\nthan the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a\\r\\nconscious endeavor. It is something to be able to paint a particular\\r\\npicture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful;\\r\\nbut it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and\\r\\nmedium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect the\\r\\nquality of the day, that is the highest of arts. Every man is tasked to\\r\\nmake his life, even in its details, worthy of the contemplation of his\\r\\nmost elevated and critical hour. If we refused, or rather used up, such\\r\\npaltry information as we get, the oracles would distinctly inform us\\r\\nhow this might be done.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front\\r\\nonly the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it\\r\\nhad to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not\\r\\nlived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor\\r\\ndid I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I\\r\\nwanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so\\r\\nsturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to\\r\\ncut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and\\r\\nreduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then\\r\\nto get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness\\r\\nto the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be\\r\\nable to give a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men,\\r\\nit appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is\\r\\nof the devil or of God, and have _somewhat hastily_ concluded that it\\r\\nis the chief end of man here to “glorify God and enjoy him forever.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStill we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were\\r\\nlong ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is\\r\\nerror upon error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its\\r\\noccasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered\\r\\naway by detail. An honest man has hardly need to count more than his\\r\\nten fingers, or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the\\r\\nrest. Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as\\r\\ntwo or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million\\r\\ncount half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb nail. In the\\r\\nmidst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are the clouds and\\r\\nstorms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed for,\\r\\nthat a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom\\r\\nand not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great\\r\\ncalculator indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three\\r\\nmeals a day, if it be necessary eat but one; instead of a hundred\\r\\ndishes, five; and reduce other things in proportion. Our life is like a\\r\\nGerman Confederacy, made up of petty states, with its boundary forever\\r\\nfluctuating, so that even a German cannot tell you how it is bounded at\\r\\nany moment. The nation itself, with all its so called internal\\r\\nimprovements, which, by the way are all external and superficial, is\\r\\njust such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered with\\r\\nfurniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and\\r\\nheedless expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the\\r\\nmillion households in the land; and the only cure for it as for them is\\r\\nin a rigid economy, a stern and more than Spartan simplicity of life\\r\\nand elevation of purpose. It lives too fast. Men think that it is\\r\\nessential that the _Nation_ have commerce, and export ice, and talk\\r\\nthrough a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour, without a doubt,\\r\\nwhether _they_ do or not; but whether we should live like baboons or\\r\\nlike men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get out sleepers, and\\r\\nforge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to\\r\\ntinkering upon our _lives_ to improve _them_, who will build railroads?\\r\\nAnd if railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season?\\r\\nBut if we stay at home and mind our business, who will want railroads?\\r\\nWe do not ride on the railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think\\r\\nwhat those sleepers are that underlie the railroad? Each one is a man,\\r\\nan Irish-man, or a Yankee man. The rails are laid on them, and they are\\r\\ncovered with sand, and the cars run smoothly over them. They are sound\\r\\nsleepers, I assure you. And every few years a new lot is laid down and\\r\\nrun over; so that, if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail,\\r\\nothers have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they run over a\\r\\nman that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong\\r\\nposition, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue\\r\\nand cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that\\r\\nit takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down\\r\\nand level in their beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may\\r\\nsometime get up again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined\\r\\nto be starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves\\r\\nnine, and so they take a thousand stitches to-day to save nine\\r\\nto-morrow. As for _work_, we haven’t any of any consequence. We have\\r\\nthe Saint Vitus’ dance, and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I\\r\\nshould only give a few pulls at the parish bell-rope, as for a fire,\\r\\nthat is, without setting the bell, there is hardly a man on his farm in\\r\\nthe outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that press of engagements\\r\\nwhich was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a boy, nor a\\r\\nwoman, I might almost say, but would forsake all and follow that sound,\\r\\nnot mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess\\r\\nthe truth, much more to see it burn, since burn it must, and we, be it\\r\\nknown, did not set it on fire,—or to see it put out, and have a hand in\\r\\nit, if that is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish\\r\\nchurch itself. Hardly a man takes a half hour’s nap after dinner, but\\r\\nwhen he wakes he holds up his head and asks, “What’s the news?” as if\\r\\nthe rest of mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be\\r\\nwaked every half hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay\\r\\nfor it, they tell what they have dreamed. After a night’s sleep the\\r\\nnews is as indispensable as the breakfast. “Pray tell me any thing new\\r\\nthat has happened to a man any where on this globe,”—and he reads it\\r\\nover his coffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this\\r\\nmorning on the Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in\\r\\nthe dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world, and has but the\\r\\nrudiment of an eye himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that\\r\\nthere are very few important communications made through it. To speak\\r\\ncritically, I never received more than one or two letters in my life—I\\r\\nwrote this some years ago—that were worth the postage. The penny-post\\r\\nis, commonly, an institution through which you seriously offer a man\\r\\nthat penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest.\\r\\nAnd I am sure that I never read any memorable news in a newspaper. If\\r\\nwe read of one man robbed, or murdered, or killed by accident, or one\\r\\nhouse burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one steamboat blown up, or one\\r\\ncow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog killed, or one lot\\r\\nof grasshoppers in the winter,—we never need read of another. One is\\r\\nenough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you care for\\r\\na myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all _news_, as it\\r\\nis called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over\\r\\ntheir tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a\\r\\nrush, as I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the\\r\\nforeign news by the last arrival, that several large squares of plate\\r\\nglass belonging to the establishment were broken by the pressure,—news\\r\\nwhich I seriously think a ready wit might write a twelve-month, or\\r\\ntwelve years, beforehand with sufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for\\r\\ninstance, if you know how to throw in Don Carlos and the Infanta, and\\r\\nDon Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to time in the right\\r\\nproportions,—they may have changed the names a little since I saw the\\r\\npapers,—and serve up a bull-fight when other entertainments fail, it\\r\\nwill be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea of the exact\\r\\nstate or ruin of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid reports\\r\\nunder this head in the newspapers: and as for England, almost the last\\r\\nsignificant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649;\\r\\nand if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year,\\r\\nyou never need attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are\\r\\nof a merely pecuniary character. If one may judge who rarely looks into\\r\\nthe newspapers, nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts, a French\\r\\nrevolution not excepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat news! how much more important to know what that is which was never\\r\\nold! “Kieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent a man to\\r\\nKhoung-tseu to know his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be\\r\\nseated near him, and questioned him in these terms: What is your master\\r\\ndoing? The messenger answered with respect: My master desires to\\r\\ndiminish the number of his faults, but he cannot come to the end of\\r\\nthem. The messenger being gone, the philosopher remarked: What a worthy\\r\\nmessenger! What a worthy messenger!” The preacher, instead of vexing\\r\\nthe ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the\\r\\nweek,—for Sunday is the fit conclusion of an ill-spent week, and not\\r\\nthe fresh and brave beginning of a new one,—with this one other\\r\\ndraggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with thundering voice, “Pause!\\r\\nAvast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly slow?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is\\r\\nfabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow\\r\\nthemselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we\\r\\nknow, would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights’\\r\\nEntertainments. If we respected only what is inevitable and has a right\\r\\nto be, music and poetry would resound along the streets. When we are\\r\\nunhurried and wise, we perceive that only great and worthy things have\\r\\nany permanent and absolute existence,—that petty fears and petty\\r\\npleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always\\r\\nexhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and\\r\\nconsenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their\\r\\ndaily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on\\r\\npurely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true\\r\\nlaw and relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily,\\r\\nbut who think that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I\\r\\nhave read in a Hindoo book, that “there was a king’s son, who, being\\r\\nexpelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester,\\r\\nand, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong\\r\\nto the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his father’s\\r\\nministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the\\r\\nmisconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a\\r\\nprince. So soul,” continues the Hindoo philosopher, “from the\\r\\ncircumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until\\r\\nthe truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it knows\\r\\nitself to be _Brahme_.” I perceive that we inhabitants of New England\\r\\nlive this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate\\r\\nthe surface of things. We think that that _is_ which _appears_ to be.\\r\\nIf a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where,\\r\\nthink you, would the “Mill-dam” go to? If he should give us an account\\r\\nof the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in\\r\\nhis description. Look at a meeting-house, or a court-house, or a jail,\\r\\nor a shop, or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is\\r\\nbefore a true gaze, and they would all go to pieces in your account of\\r\\nthem. Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind\\r\\nthe farthest star, before Adam and after the last man. In eternity\\r\\nthere is indeed something true and sublime. But all these times and\\r\\nplaces and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates in the\\r\\npresent moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the\\r\\nages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble\\r\\nonly by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that\\r\\nsurrounds us. The universe constantly and obediently answers to our\\r\\nconceptions; whether we travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us.\\r\\nLet us spend our lives in conceiving then. The poet or the artist never\\r\\nyet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least\\r\\ncould accomplish it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off\\r\\nthe track by every nutshell and mosquito’s wing that falls on the\\r\\nrails. Let us rise early and fast, or break fast, gently and without\\r\\nperturbation; let company come and let company go, let the bells ring\\r\\nand the children cry,—determined to make a day of it. Why should we\\r\\nknock under and go with the stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed\\r\\nin that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner, situated in the\\r\\nmeridian shallows. Weather this danger and you are safe, for the rest\\r\\nof the way is down hill. With unrelaxed nerves, with morning vigor,\\r\\nsail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast like Ulysses. If the\\r\\nengine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains. If the\\r\\nbell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of music they\\r\\nare like. Let us settle ourselves, and work and wedge our feet downward\\r\\nthrough the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and\\r\\ndelusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe, through\\r\\nParis and London, through New York and Boston and Concord, through\\r\\nchurch and state, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we\\r\\ncome to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call _reality_,\\r\\nand say, This is, and no mistake; and then begin, having a _point\\r\\nd’appui_, below freshet and frost and fire, a place where you might\\r\\nfound a wall or a state, or set a lamp-post safely, or perhaps a gauge,\\r\\nnot a Nilometer, but a Realometer, that future ages might know how deep\\r\\na freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time. If\\r\\nyou stand right fronting and face to face to a fact, you will see the\\r\\nsun glimmer on both its surfaces, as if it were a cimeter, and feel its\\r\\nsweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow, and so you will\\r\\nhappily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or death, we crave only\\r\\nreality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our throats\\r\\nand feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our\\r\\nbusiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I\\r\\ndrink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin\\r\\ncurrent slides away, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish\\r\\nin the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I\\r\\nknow not the first letter of the alphabet. I have always been\\r\\nregretting that I was not as wise as the day I was born. The intellect\\r\\nis a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things.\\r\\nI do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary. My\\r\\nhead is hands and feet. I feel all my best faculties concentrated in\\r\\nit. My instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as\\r\\nsome creatures use their snout and fore-paws, and with it I would mine\\r\\nand burrow my way through these hills. I think that the richest vein is\\r\\nsomewhere hereabouts; so by the divining-rod and thin rising vapors I\\r\\njudge; and here I will begin to mine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReading\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a little more deliberation in the choice of their pursuits, all\\r\\nmen would perhaps become essentially students and observers, for\\r\\ncertainly their nature and destiny are interesting to all alike. In\\r\\naccumulating property for ourselves or our posterity, in founding a\\r\\nfamily or a state, or acquiring fame even, we are mortal; but in\\r\\ndealing with truth we are immortal, and need fear no change nor\\r\\naccident. The oldest Egyptian or Hindoo philosopher raised a corner of\\r\\nthe veil from the statue of the divinity; and still the trembling robe\\r\\nremains raised, and I gaze upon as fresh a glory as he did, since it\\r\\nwas I in him that was then so bold, and it is he in me that now reviews\\r\\nthe vision. No dust has settled on that robe; no time has elapsed since\\r\\nthat divinity was revealed. That time which we really improve, or which\\r\\nis improvable, is neither past, present, nor future.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy residence was more favorable, not only to thought, but to serious\\r\\nreading, than a university; and though I was beyond the range of the\\r\\nordinary circulating library, I had more than ever come within the\\r\\ninfluence of those books which circulate round the world, whose\\r\\nsentences were first written on bark, and are now merely copied from\\r\\ntime to time on to linen paper. Says the poet Mîr Camar Uddîn Mast,\\r\\n“Being seated to run through the region of the spiritual world; I have\\r\\nhad this advantage in books. To be intoxicated by a single glass of\\r\\nwine; I have experienced this pleasure when I have drunk the liquor of\\r\\nthe esoteric doctrines.” I kept Homer’s Iliad on my table through the\\r\\nsummer, though I looked at his page only now and then. Incessant labor\\r\\nwith my hands, at first, for I had my house to finish and my beans to\\r\\nhoe at the same time, made more study impossible. Yet I sustained\\r\\nmyself by the prospect of such reading in future. I read one or two\\r\\nshallow books of travel in the intervals of my work, till that\\r\\nemployment made me ashamed of myself, and I asked where it was then\\r\\nthat _I_ lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe student may read Homer or Æschylus in the Greek without danger of\\r\\ndissipation or luxuriousness, for it implies that he in some measure\\r\\nemulate their heroes, and consecrate morning hours to their pages. The\\r\\nheroic books, even if printed in the character of our mother tongue,\\r\\nwill always be in a language dead to degenerate times; and we must\\r\\nlaboriously seek the meaning of each word and line, conjecturing a\\r\\nlarger sense than common use permits out of what wisdom and valor and\\r\\ngenerosity we have. The modern cheap and fertile press, with all its\\r\\ntranslations, has done little to bring us nearer to the heroic writers\\r\\nof antiquity. They seem as solitary, and the letter in which they are\\r\\nprinted as rare and curious, as ever. It is worth the expense of\\r\\nyouthful days and costly hours, if you learn only some words of an\\r\\nancient language, which are raised out of the trivialness of the\\r\\nstreet, to be perpetual suggestions and provocations. It is not in vain\\r\\nthat the farmer remembers and repeats the few Latin words which he has\\r\\nheard. Men sometimes speak as if the study of the classics would at\\r\\nlength make way for more modern and practical studies; but the\\r\\nadventurous student will always study classics, in whatever language\\r\\nthey may be written and however ancient they may be. For what are the\\r\\nclassics but the noblest recorded thoughts of man? They are the only\\r\\noracles which are not decayed, and there are such answers to the most\\r\\nmodern inquiry in them as Delphi and Dodona never gave. We might as\\r\\nwell omit to study Nature because she is old. To read well, that is, to\\r\\nread true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that\\r\\nwill task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the\\r\\nday esteem. It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the\\r\\nsteady intention almost of the whole life to this object. Books must be\\r\\nread as deliberately and reservedly as they were written. It is not\\r\\nenough even to be able to speak the language of that nation by which\\r\\nthey are written, for there is a memorable interval between the spoken\\r\\nand the written language, the language heard and the language read. The\\r\\none is commonly transitory, a sound, a tongue, a dialect merely, almost\\r\\nbrutish, and we learn it unconsciously, like the brutes, of our\\r\\nmothers. The other is the maturity and experience of that; if that is\\r\\nour mother tongue, this is our father tongue, a reserved and select\\r\\nexpression, too significant to be heard by the ear, which we must be\\r\\nborn again in order to speak. The crowds of men who merely _spoke_ the\\r\\nGreek and Latin tongues in the middle ages were not entitled by the\\r\\naccident of birth to _read_ the works of genius written in those\\r\\nlanguages; for these were not written in that Greek or Latin which they\\r\\nknew, but in the select language of literature. They had not learned\\r\\nthe nobler dialects of Greece and Rome, but the very materials on which\\r\\nthey were written were waste paper to them, and they prized instead a\\r\\ncheap contemporary literature. But when the several nations of Europe\\r\\nhad acquired distinct though rude written languages of their own,\\r\\nsufficient for the purposes of their rising literatures, then first\\r\\nlearning revived, and scholars were enabled to discern from that\\r\\nremoteness the treasures of antiquity. What the Roman and Grecian\\r\\nmultitude could not _hear_, after the lapse of ages a few scholars\\r\\n_read_, and a few scholars only are still reading it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever much we may admire the orator’s occasional bursts of eloquence,\\r\\nthe noblest written words are commonly as far behind or above the\\r\\nfleeting spoken language as the firmament with its stars is behind the\\r\\nclouds. _There_ are the stars, and they who can may read them. The\\r\\nastronomers forever comment on and observe them. They are not\\r\\nexhalations like our daily colloquies and vaporous breath. What is\\r\\ncalled eloquence in the forum is commonly found to be rhetoric in the\\r\\nstudy. The orator yields to the inspiration of a transient occasion,\\r\\nand speaks to the mob before him, to those who can _hear_ him; but the\\r\\nwriter, whose more equable life is his occasion, and who would be\\r\\ndistracted by the event and the crowd which inspire the orator, speaks\\r\\nto the intellect and health of mankind, to all in any age who can\\r\\n_understand_ him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo wonder that Alexander carried the Iliad with him on his expeditions\\r\\nin a precious casket. A written word is the choicest of relics. It is\\r\\nsomething at once more intimate with us and more universal than any\\r\\nother work of art. It is the work of art nearest to life itself. It may\\r\\nbe translated into every language, and not only be read but actually\\r\\nbreathed from all human lips;—not be represented on canvas or in marble\\r\\nonly, but be carved out of the breath of life itself. The symbol of an\\r\\nancient man’s thought becomes a modern man’s speech. Two thousand\\r\\nsummers have imparted to the monuments of Grecian literature, as to her\\r\\nmarbles, only a maturer golden and autumnal tint, for they have carried\\r\\ntheir own serene and celestial atmosphere into all lands to protect\\r\\nthem against the corrosion of time. Books are the treasured wealth of\\r\\nthe world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations. Books,\\r\\nthe oldest and the best, stand naturally and rightfully on the shelves\\r\\nof every cottage. They have no cause of their own to plead, but while\\r\\nthey enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse\\r\\nthem. Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every\\r\\nsociety, and, more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on\\r\\nmankind. When the illiterate and perhaps scornful trader has earned by\\r\\nenterprise and industry his coveted leisure and independence, and is\\r\\nadmitted to the circles of wealth and fashion, he turns inevitably at\\r\\nlast to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles of intellect\\r\\nand genius, and is sensible only of the imperfection of his culture and\\r\\nthe vanity and insufficiency of all his riches, and further proves his\\r\\ngood sense by the pains which he takes to secure for his children that\\r\\nintellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels; and thus it is that\\r\\nhe becomes the founder of a family.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language\\r\\nin which they were written must have a very imperfect knowledge of the\\r\\nhistory of the human race; for it is remarkable that no transcript of\\r\\nthem has ever been made into any modern tongue, unless our civilization\\r\\nitself may be regarded as such a transcript. Homer has never yet been\\r\\nprinted in English, nor Æschylus, nor Virgil even—works as refined, as\\r\\nsolidly done, and as beautiful almost as the morning itself; for later\\r\\nwriters, say what we will of their genius, have rarely, if ever,\\r\\nequalled the elaborate beauty and finish and the lifelong and heroic\\r\\nliterary labors of the ancients. They only talk of forgetting them who\\r\\nnever knew them. It will be soon enough to forget them when we have the\\r\\nlearning and the genius which will enable us to attend to and\\r\\nappreciate them. That age will be rich indeed when those relics which\\r\\nwe call Classics, and the still older and more than classic but even\\r\\nless known Scriptures of the nations, shall have still further\\r\\naccumulated, when the Vaticans shall be filled with Vedas and\\r\\nZendavestas and Bibles, with Homers and Dantes and Shakespeares, and\\r\\nall the centuries to come shall have successively deposited their\\r\\ntrophies in the forum of the world. By such a pile we may hope to scale\\r\\nheaven at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe works of the great poets have never yet been read by mankind, for\\r\\nonly great poets can read them. They have only been read as the\\r\\nmultitude read the stars, at most astrologically, not astronomically.\\r\\nMost men have learned to read to serve a paltry convenience, as they\\r\\nhave learned to cipher in order to keep accounts and not be cheated in\\r\\ntrade; but of reading as a noble intellectual exercise they know little\\r\\nor nothing; yet this only is reading, in a high sense, not that which\\r\\nlulls us as a luxury and suffers the nobler faculties to sleep the\\r\\nwhile, but what we have to stand on tip-toe to read and devote our most\\r\\nalert and wakeful hours to.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that having learned our letters we should read the best that is\\r\\nin literature, and not be forever repeating our a b abs, and words of\\r\\none syllable, in the fourth or fifth classes, sitting on the lowest and\\r\\nforemost form all our lives. Most men are satisfied if they read or\\r\\nhear read, and perchance have been convicted by the wisdom of one good\\r\\nbook, the Bible, and for the rest of their lives vegetate and dissipate\\r\\ntheir faculties in what is called easy reading. There is a work in\\r\\nseveral volumes in our Circulating Library entitled Little Reading,\\r\\nwhich I thought referred to a town of that name which I had not been\\r\\nto. There are those who, like cormorants and ostriches, can digest all\\r\\nsorts of this, even after the fullest dinner of meats and vegetables,\\r\\nfor they suffer nothing to be wasted. If others are the machines to\\r\\nprovide this provender, they are the machines to read it. They read the\\r\\nnine thousandth tale about Zebulon and Sephronia, and how they loved as\\r\\nnone had ever loved before, and neither did the course of their true\\r\\nlove run smooth,—at any rate, how it did run and stumble, and get up\\r\\nagain and go on! how some poor unfortunate got up on to a steeple, who\\r\\nhad better never have gone up as far as the belfry; and then, having\\r\\nneedlessly got him up there, the happy novelist rings the bell for all\\r\\nthe world to come together and hear, O dear! how he did get down again!\\r\\nFor my part, I think that they had better metamorphose all such\\r\\naspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man weathercocks, as they\\r\\nused to put heroes among the constellations, and let them swing round\\r\\nthere till they are rusty, and not come down at all to bother honest\\r\\nmen with their pranks. The next time the novelist rings the bell I will\\r\\nnot stir though the meeting-house burn down. “The Skip of the\\r\\nTip-Toe-Hop, a Romance of the Middle Ages, by the celebrated author of\\r\\n‘Tittle-Tol-Tan,’ to appear in monthly parts; a great rush; don’t all\\r\\ncome together.” All this they read with saucer eyes, and erect and\\r\\nprimitive curiosity, and with unwearied gizzard, whose corrugations\\r\\neven yet need no sharpening, just as some little four-year-old bencher\\r\\nhis two-cent gilt-covered edition of Cinderella,—without any\\r\\nimprovement, that I can see, in the pronunciation, or accent, or\\r\\nemphasis, or any more skill in extracting or inserting the moral. The\\r\\nresult is dulness of sight, a stagnation of the vital circulations, and\\r\\na general deliquium and sloughing off of all the intellectual\\r\\nfaculties. This sort of gingerbread is baked daily and more sedulously\\r\\nthan pure wheat or rye-and-Indian in almost every oven, and finds a\\r\\nsurer market.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best books are not read even by those who are called good readers.\\r\\nWhat does our Concord culture amount to? There is in this town, with a\\r\\nvery few exceptions, no taste for the best or for very good books even\\r\\nin English literature, whose words all can read and spell. Even the\\r\\ncollege-bred and so called liberally educated men here and elsewhere\\r\\nhave really little or no acquaintance with the English classics; and as\\r\\nfor the recorded wisdom of mankind, the ancient classics and Bibles,\\r\\nwhich are accessible to all who will know of them, there are the\\r\\nfeeblest efforts any where made to become acquainted with them. I know\\r\\na woodchopper, of middle age, who takes a French paper, not for news as\\r\\nhe says, for he is above that, but to “keep himself in practice,” he\\r\\nbeing a Canadian by birth; and when I ask him what he considers the\\r\\nbest thing he can do in this world, he says, beside this, to keep up\\r\\nand add to his English. This is about as much as the college bred\\r\\ngenerally do or aspire to do, and they take an English paper for the\\r\\npurpose. One who has just come from reading perhaps one of the best\\r\\nEnglish books will find how many with whom he can converse about it? Or\\r\\nsuppose he comes from reading a Greek or Latin classic in the original,\\r\\nwhose praises are familiar even to the so called illiterate; he will\\r\\nfind nobody at all to speak to, but must keep silence about it. Indeed,\\r\\nthere is hardly the professor in our colleges, who, if he has mastered\\r\\nthe difficulties of the language, has proportionally mastered the\\r\\ndifficulties of the wit and poetry of a Greek poet, and has any\\r\\nsympathy to impart to the alert and heroic reader; and as for the\\r\\nsacred Scriptures, or Bibles of mankind, who in this town can tell me\\r\\neven their titles? Most men do not know that any nation but the Hebrews\\r\\nhave had a scripture. A man, any man, will go considerably out of his\\r\\nway to pick up a silver dollar; but here are golden words, which the\\r\\nwisest men of antiquity have uttered, and whose worth the wise of every\\r\\nsucceeding age have assured us of;—and yet we learn to read only as far\\r\\nas Easy Reading, the primers and class-books, and when we leave school,\\r\\nthe “Little Reading,” and story books, which are for boys and\\r\\nbeginners; and our reading, our conversation and thinking, are all on a\\r\\nvery low level, worthy only of pygmies and manikins.\\r\\n\\r\\nI aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this our Concord soil has\\r\\nproduced, whose names are hardly known here. Or shall I hear the name\\r\\nof Plato and never read his book? As if Plato were my townsman and I\\r\\nnever saw him,—my next neighbor and I never heard him speak or attended\\r\\nto the wisdom of his words. But how actually is it? His Dialogues,\\r\\nwhich contain what was immortal in him, lie on the next shelf, and yet\\r\\nI never read them. We are underbred and low-lived and illiterate; and\\r\\nin this respect I confess I do not make any very broad distinction\\r\\nbetween the illiterateness of my townsman who cannot read at all, and\\r\\nthe illiterateness of him who has learned to read only what is for\\r\\nchildren and feeble intellects. We should be as good as the worthies of\\r\\nantiquity, but partly by first knowing how good they were. We are a\\r\\nrace of tit-men, and soar but little higher in our intellectual flights\\r\\nthan the columns of the daily paper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not all books that are as dull as their readers. There are\\r\\nprobably words addressed to our condition exactly, which, if we could\\r\\nreally hear and understand, would be more salutary than the morning or\\r\\nthe spring to our lives, and possibly put a new aspect on the face of\\r\\nthings for us. How many a man has dated a new era in his life from the\\r\\nreading of a book. The book exists for us perchance which will explain\\r\\nour miracles and reveal new ones. The at present unutterable things we\\r\\nmay find somewhere uttered. These same questions that disturb and\\r\\npuzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise men;\\r\\nnot one has been omitted; and each has answered them, according to his\\r\\nability, by his words and his life. Moreover, with wisdom we shall\\r\\nlearn liberality. The solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts of\\r\\nConcord, who has had his second birth and peculiar religious\\r\\nexperience, and is driven as he believes into the silent gravity and\\r\\nexclusiveness by his faith, may think it is not true; but Zoroaster,\\r\\nthousands of years ago, travelled the same road and had the same\\r\\nexperience; but he, being wise, knew it to be universal, and treated\\r\\nhis neighbors accordingly, and is even said to have invented and\\r\\nestablished worship among men. Let him humbly commune with Zoroaster\\r\\nthen, and through the liberalizing influence of all the worthies, with\\r\\nJesus Christ himself, and let “our church” go by the board.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe boast that we belong to the nineteenth century and are making the\\r\\nmost rapid strides of any nation. But consider how little this village\\r\\ndoes for its own culture. I do not wish to flatter my townsmen, nor to\\r\\nbe flattered by them, for that will not advance either of us. We need\\r\\nto be provoked,—goaded like oxen, as we are, into a trot. We have a\\r\\ncomparatively decent system of common schools, schools for infants\\r\\nonly; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the winter, and latterly\\r\\nthe puny beginning of a library suggested by the state, no school for\\r\\nourselves. We spend more on almost any article of bodily aliment or\\r\\nailment than on our mental aliment. It is time that we had uncommon\\r\\nschools, that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be\\r\\nmen and women. It is time that villages were universities, and their\\r\\nelder inhabitants the fellows of universities, with leisure—if they are\\r\\nindeed so well off—to pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives.\\r\\nShall the world be confined to one Paris or one Oxford forever? Cannot\\r\\nstudents be boarded here and get a liberal education under the skies of\\r\\nConcord? Can we not hire some Abelard to lecture to us? Alas! what with\\r\\nfoddering the cattle and tending the store, we are kept from school too\\r\\nlong, and our education is sadly neglected. In this country, the\\r\\nvillage should in some respects take the place of the nobleman of\\r\\nEurope. It should be the patron of the fine arts. It is rich enough. It\\r\\nwants only the magnanimity and refinement. It can spend money enough on\\r\\nsuch things as farmers and traders value, but it is thought Utopian to\\r\\npropose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to be\\r\\nof far more worth. This town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a\\r\\ntown-house, thank fortune or politics, but probably it will not spend\\r\\nso much on living wit, the true meat to put into that shell, in a\\r\\nhundred years. The one hundred and twenty-five dollars annually\\r\\nsubscribed for a Lyceum in the winter is better spent than any other\\r\\nequal sum raised in the town. If we live in the nineteenth century, why\\r\\nshould we not enjoy the advantages which the nineteenth century offers?\\r\\nWhy should our life be in any respect provincial? If we will read\\r\\nnewspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and take the best\\r\\nnewspaper in the world at once?—not be sucking the pap of “neutral\\r\\nfamily” papers, or browsing “Olive-Branches” here in New England. Let\\r\\nthe reports of all the learned societies come to us, and we will see if\\r\\nthey know any thing. Why should we leave it to Harper & Brothers and\\r\\nRedding & Co. to select our reading? As the nobleman of cultivated\\r\\ntaste surrounds himself with whatever conduces to his\\r\\nculture,—genius—learning—wit—books—paintings—statuary—music—\\r\\nphilosophical instruments, and the like; so let the village do,—not\\r\\nstop short at a pedagogue, a parson, a sexton, a parish library, and\\r\\nthree selectmen, because our pilgrim forefathers got through a cold\\r\\nwinter once on a bleak rock with these. To act collectively is\\r\\naccording to the spirit of our institutions; and I am confident that,\\r\\nas our circumstances are more flourishing, our means are greater than\\r\\nthe nobleman’s. New England can hire all the wise men in the world to\\r\\ncome and teach her, and board them round the while, and not be\\r\\nprovincial at all. That is the _uncommon_ school we want. Instead of\\r\\nnoblemen, let us have noble villages of men. If it is necessary, omit\\r\\none bridge over the river, go round a little there, and throw one arch\\r\\nat least over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSounds\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while we are confined to books, though the most select and classic,\\r\\nand read only particular written languages, which are themselves but\\r\\ndialects and provincial, we are in danger of forgetting the language\\r\\nwhich all things and events speak without metaphor, which alone is\\r\\ncopious and standard. Much is published, but little printed. The rays\\r\\nwhich stream through the shutter will be no longer remembered when the\\r\\nshutter is wholly removed. No method nor discipline can supersede the\\r\\nnecessity of being forever on the alert. What is a course of history,\\r\\nor philosophy, or poetry, no matter how well selected, or the best\\r\\nsociety, or the most admirable routine of life, compared with the\\r\\ndiscipline of looking always at what is to be seen? Will you be a\\r\\nreader, a student merely, or a seer? Read your fate, see what is before\\r\\nyou, and walk on into futurity.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not read books the first summer; I hoed beans. Nay, I often did\\r\\nbetter than this. There were times when I could not afford to sacrifice\\r\\nthe bloom of the present moment to any work, whether of the head or\\r\\nhands. I love a broad margin to my life. Sometimes, in a summer\\r\\nmorning, having taken my accustomed bath, I sat in my sunny doorway\\r\\nfrom sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery, amidst the pines and\\r\\nhickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and stillness, while the\\r\\nbirds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house, until by the\\r\\nsun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some traveller’s\\r\\nwagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of time. I\\r\\ngrew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better\\r\\nthan any work of the hands would have been. They were not time\\r\\nsubtracted from my life, but so much over and above my usual allowance.\\r\\nI realized what the Orientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking\\r\\nof works. For the most part, I minded not how the hours went. The day\\r\\nadvanced as if to light some work of mine; it was morning, and lo, now\\r\\nit is evening, and nothing memorable is accomplished. Instead of\\r\\nsinging like the birds, I silently smiled at my incessant good fortune.\\r\\nAs the sparrow had its trill, sitting on the hickory before my door, so\\r\\nhad I my chuckle or suppressed warble which he might hear out of my\\r\\nnest. My days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any\\r\\nheathen deity, nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the\\r\\nticking of a clock; for I lived like the Puri Indians, of whom it is\\r\\nsaid that “for yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow they have only one\\r\\nword, and they express the variety of meaning by pointing backward for\\r\\nyesterday, forward for to-morrow, and overhead for the passing day.”\\r\\nThis was sheer idleness to my fellow-townsmen, no doubt; but if the\\r\\nbirds and flowers had tried me by their standard, I should not have\\r\\nbeen found wanting. A man must find his occasions in himself, it is\\r\\ntrue. The natural day is very calm, and will hardly reprove his\\r\\nindolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had this advantage, at least, in my mode of life, over those who were\\r\\nobliged to look abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre, that\\r\\nmy life itself was become my amusement and never ceased to be novel. It\\r\\nwas a drama of many scenes and without an end. If we were always indeed\\r\\ngetting our living, and regulating our lives according to the last and\\r\\nbest mode we had learned, we should never be troubled with ennui.\\r\\nFollow your genius closely enough, and it will not fail to show you a\\r\\nfresh prospect every hour. Housework was a pleasant pastime. When my\\r\\nfloor was dirty, I rose early, and, setting all my furniture out of\\r\\ndoors on the grass, bed and bedstead making but one budget, dashed\\r\\nwater on the floor, and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it, and\\r\\nthen with a broom scrubbed it clean and white; and by the time the\\r\\nvillagers had broken their fast the morning sun had dried my house\\r\\nsufficiently to allow me to move in again, and my meditations were\\r\\nalmost uninterupted. It was pleasant to see my whole household effects\\r\\nout on the grass, making a little pile like a gypsy’s pack, and my\\r\\nthree-legged table, from which I did not remove the books and pen and\\r\\nink, standing amid the pines and hickories. They seemed glad to get out\\r\\nthemselves, and as if unwilling to be brought in. I was sometimes\\r\\ntempted to stretch an awning over them and take my seat there. It was\\r\\nworth the while to see the sun shine on these things, and hear the free\\r\\nwind blow on them; so much more interesting most familiar objects look\\r\\nout of doors than in the house. A bird sits on the next bough,\\r\\nlife-everlasting grows under the table, and blackberry vines run round\\r\\nits legs; pine cones, chestnut burs, and strawberry leaves are strewn\\r\\nabout. It looked as if this was the way these forms came to be\\r\\ntransferred to our furniture, to tables, chairs, and bedsteads,—because\\r\\nthey once stood in their midst.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy house was on the side of a hill, immediately on the edge of the\\r\\nlarger wood, in the midst of a young forest of pitch pines and\\r\\nhickories, and half a dozen rods from the pond, to which a narrow\\r\\nfootpath led down the hill. In my front yard grew the strawberry,\\r\\nblackberry, and life-everlasting, johnswort and goldenrod, shrub-oaks\\r\\nand sand-cherry, blueberry and groundnut. Near the end of May, the\\r\\nsand-cherry (_Cerasus pumila_,) adorned the sides of the path with its\\r\\ndelicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its short\\r\\nstems, which last, in the fall, weighed down with good sized and\\r\\nhandsome cherries, fell over in wreaths like rays on every side. I\\r\\ntasted them out of compliment to Nature, though they were scarcely\\r\\npalatable. The sumach (_Rhus glabra_,) grew luxuriantly about the\\r\\nhouse, pushing up through the embankment which I had made, and growing\\r\\nfive or six feet the first season. Its broad pinnate tropical leaf was\\r\\npleasant though strange to look on. The large buds, suddenly pushing\\r\\nout late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead,\\r\\ndeveloped themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs,\\r\\nan inch in diameter; and sometimes, as I sat at my window, so\\r\\nheedlessly did they grow and tax their weak joints, I heard a fresh and\\r\\ntender bough suddenly fall like a fan to the ground, when there was not\\r\\na breath of air stirring, broken off by its own weight. In August, the\\r\\nlarge masses of berries, which, when in flower, had attracted many wild\\r\\nbees, gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson hue, and by their\\r\\nweight again bent down and broke the tender limbs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I sit at my window this summer afternoon, hawks are circling about\\r\\nmy clearing; the tantivy of wild pigeons, flying by twos and threes\\r\\nathwart my view, or perching restless on the white-pine boughs behind\\r\\nmy house, gives a voice to the air; a fishhawk dimples the glassy\\r\\nsurface of the pond and brings up a fish; a mink steals out of the\\r\\nmarsh before my door and seizes a frog by the shore; the sedge is\\r\\nbending under the weight of the reed-birds flitting hither and thither;\\r\\nand for the last half hour I have heard the rattle of railroad cars,\\r\\nnow dying away and then reviving like the beat of a partridge,\\r\\nconveying travellers from Boston to the country. For I did not live so\\r\\nout of the world as that boy who, as I hear, was put out to a farmer in\\r\\nthe east part of the town, but ere long ran away and came home again,\\r\\nquite down at the heel and homesick. He had never seen such a dull and\\r\\nout-of-the-way place; the folks were all gone off; why, you couldn’t\\r\\neven hear the whistle! I doubt if there is such a place in\\r\\nMassachusetts now:—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “In truth, our village has become a butt\\r\\n     For one of those fleet railroad shafts, and o’er\\r\\n     Our peaceful plain its soothing sound is—Concord.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Fitchburg Railroad touches the pond about a hundred rods south of\\r\\nwhere I dwell. I usually go to the village along its causeway, and am,\\r\\nas it were, related to society by this link. The men on the freight\\r\\ntrains, who go over the whole length of the road, bow to me as to an\\r\\nold acquaintance, they pass me so often, and apparently they take me\\r\\nfor an employee; and so I am. I too would fain be a track-repairer\\r\\nsomewhere in the orbit of the earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whistle of the locomotive penetrates my woods summer and winter,\\r\\nsounding like the scream of a hawk sailing over some farmer’s yard,\\r\\ninforming me that many restless city merchants are arriving within the\\r\\ncircle of the town, or adventurous country traders from the other side.\\r\\nAs they come under one horizon, they shout their warning to get off the\\r\\ntrack to the other, heard sometimes through the circles of two towns.\\r\\nHere come your groceries, country; your rations, countrymen! Nor is\\r\\nthere any man so independent on his farm that he can say them nay. And\\r\\nhere’s your pay for them! screams the countryman’s whistle; timber like\\r\\nlong battering rams going twenty miles an hour against the city’s\\r\\nwalls, and chairs enough to seat all the weary and heavy laden that\\r\\ndwell within them. With such huge and lumbering civility the country\\r\\nhands a chair to the city. All the Indian huckleberry hills are\\r\\nstripped, all the cranberry meadows are raked into the city. Up comes\\r\\nthe cotton, down goes the woven cloth; up comes the silk, down goes the\\r\\nwoollen; up come the books, but down goes the wit that writes them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I meet the engine with its train of cars moving off with planetary\\r\\nmotion,—or, rather, like a comet, for the beholder knows not if with\\r\\nthat velocity and with that direction it will ever revisit this system,\\r\\nsince its orbit does not look like a returning curve,—with its steam\\r\\ncloud like a banner streaming behind in golden and silver wreaths, like\\r\\nmany a downy cloud which I have seen, high in the heavens, unfolding\\r\\nits masses to the light,—as if this travelling demigod, this\\r\\ncloud-compeller, would ere long take the sunset sky for the livery of\\r\\nhis train; when I hear the iron horse make the hills echo with his\\r\\nsnort like thunder, shaking the earth with his feet, and breathing fire\\r\\nand smoke from his nostrils, (what kind of winged horse or fiery dragon\\r\\nthey will put into the new Mythology I don’t know), it seems as if the\\r\\nearth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it. If all were as it seems,\\r\\nand men made the elements their servants for noble ends! If the cloud\\r\\nthat hangs over the engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds, or as\\r\\nbeneficent as that which floats over the farmer’s fields, then the\\r\\nelements and Nature herself would cheerfully accompany men on their\\r\\nerrands and be their escort.\\r\\n\\r\\nI watch the passage of the morning cars with the same feeling that I do\\r\\nthe rising of the sun, which is hardly more regular. Their train of\\r\\nclouds stretching far behind and rising higher and higher, going to\\r\\nheaven while the cars are going to Boston, conceals the sun for a\\r\\nminute and casts my distant field into the shade, a celestial train\\r\\nbeside which the petty train of cars which hugs the earth is but the\\r\\nbarb of the spear. The stabler of the iron horse was up early this\\r\\nwinter morning by the light of the stars amid the mountains, to fodder\\r\\nand harness his steed. Fire, too, was awakened thus early to put the\\r\\nvital heat in him and get him off. If the enterprise were as innocent\\r\\nas it is early! If the snow lies deep, they strap on his snow-shoes,\\r\\nand with the giant plow, plow a furrow from the mountains to the\\r\\nseaboard, in which the cars, like a following drill-barrow, sprinkle\\r\\nall the restless men and floating merchandise in the country for seed.\\r\\nAll day the fire-steed flies over the country, stopping only that his\\r\\nmaster may rest, and I am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at\\r\\nmidnight, when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elements\\r\\nincased in ice and snow; and he will reach his stall only with the\\r\\nmorning star, to start once more on his travels without rest or\\r\\nslumber. Or perchance, at evening, I hear him in his stable blowing off\\r\\nthe superfluous energy of the day, that he may calm his nerves and cool\\r\\nhis liver and brain for a few hours of iron slumber. If the enterprise\\r\\nwere as heroic and commanding as it is protracted and unwearied!\\r\\n\\r\\nFar through unfrequented woods on the confines of towns, where once\\r\\nonly the hunter penetrated by day, in the darkest night dart these\\r\\nbright saloons without the knowledge of their inhabitants; this moment\\r\\nstopping at some brilliant station-house in town or city, where a\\r\\nsocial crowd is gathered, the next in the Dismal Swamp, scaring the owl\\r\\nand fox. The startings and arrivals of the cars are now the epochs in\\r\\nthe village day. They go and come with such regularity and precision,\\r\\nand their whistle can be heard so far, that the farmers set their\\r\\nclocks by them, and thus one well conducted institution regulates a\\r\\nwhole country. Have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since the\\r\\nrailroad was invented? Do they not talk and think faster in the depot\\r\\nthan they did in the stage-office? There is something electrifying in\\r\\nthe atmosphere of the former place. I have been astonished at the\\r\\nmiracles it has wrought; that some of my neighbors, who, I should have\\r\\nprophesied, once for all, would never get to Boston by so prompt a\\r\\nconveyance, are on hand when the bell rings. To do things “railroad\\r\\nfashion” is now the by-word; and it is worth the while to be warned so\\r\\noften and so sincerely by any power to get off its track. There is no\\r\\nstopping to read the riot act, no firing over the heads of the mob, in\\r\\nthis case. We have constructed a fate, an _Atropos_, that never turns\\r\\naside. (Let that be the name of your engine.) Men are advertised that\\r\\nat a certain hour and minute these bolts will be shot toward particular\\r\\npoints of the compass; yet it interferes with no man’s business, and\\r\\nthe children go to school on the other track. We live the steadier for\\r\\nit. We are all educated thus to be sons of Tell. The air is full of\\r\\ninvisible bolts. Every path but your own is the path of fate. Keep on\\r\\nyour own track, then.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery. It does\\r\\nnot clasp its hands and pray to Jupiter. I see these men every day go\\r\\nabout their business with more or less courage and content, doing more\\r\\neven than they suspect, and perchance better employed than they could\\r\\nhave consciously devised. I am less affected by their heroism who stood\\r\\nup for half an hour in the front line at Buena Vista, than by the\\r\\nsteady and cheerful valor of the men who inhabit the snow-plough for\\r\\ntheir winter quarters; who have not merely the three-o’-clock in the\\r\\nmorning courage, which Bonaparte thought was the rarest, but whose\\r\\ncourage does not go to rest so early, who go to sleep only when the\\r\\nstorm sleeps or the sinews of their iron steed are frozen. On this\\r\\nmorning of the Great Snow, perchance, which is still raging and\\r\\nchilling men’s blood, I hear the muffled tone of their engine bell from\\r\\nout the fog bank of their chilled breath, which announces that the cars\\r\\n_are coming_, without long delay, notwithstanding the veto of a New\\r\\nEngland north-east snow storm, and I behold the ploughmen covered with\\r\\nsnow and rime, their heads peering, above the mould-board which is\\r\\nturning down other than daisies and the nests of field-mice, like\\r\\nbowlders of the Sierra Nevada, that occupy an outside place in the\\r\\nuniverse.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommerce is unexpectedly confident and serene, alert, adventurous, and\\r\\nunwearied. It is very natural in its methods withal, far more so than\\r\\nmany fantastic enterprises and sentimental experiments, and hence its\\r\\nsingular success. I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train\\r\\nrattles past me, and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors\\r\\nall the way from Long Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign\\r\\nparts, of coral reefs, and Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the\\r\\nextent of the globe. I feel more like a citizen of the world at the\\r\\nsight of the palm-leaf which will cover so many flaxen New England\\r\\nheads the next summer, the Manilla hemp and cocoa-nut husks, the old\\r\\njunk, gunny bags, scrap iron, and rusty nails. This car-load of torn\\r\\nsails is more legible and interesting now than if they should be\\r\\nwrought into paper and printed books. Who can write so graphically the\\r\\nhistory of the storms they have weathered as these rents have done?\\r\\nThey are proof-sheets which need no correction. Here goes lumber from\\r\\nthe Maine woods, which did not go out to sea in the last freshet, risen\\r\\nfour dollars on the thousand because of what did go out or was split\\r\\nup; pine, spruce, cedar,—first, second, third, and fourth qualities, so\\r\\nlately all of one quality, to wave over the bear, and moose, and\\r\\ncaribou. Next rolls Thomaston lime, a prime lot, which will get far\\r\\namong the hills before it gets slacked. These rags in bales, of all\\r\\nhues and qualities, the lowest condition to which cotton and linen\\r\\ndescend, the final result of dress,—of patterns which are now no longer\\r\\ncried up, unless it be in Milwaukie, as those splendid articles,\\r\\nEnglish, French, or American prints, ginghams, muslins, &c., gathered\\r\\nfrom all quarters both of fashion and poverty, going to become paper of\\r\\none color or a few shades only, on which forsooth will be written tales\\r\\nof real life, high and low, and founded on fact! This closed car smells\\r\\nof salt fish, the strong New England and commercial scent, reminding me\\r\\nof the Grand Banks and the fisheries. Who has not seen a salt fish,\\r\\nthoroughly cured for this world, so that nothing can spoil it, and\\r\\nputting the perseverance of the saints to the blush? with which you may\\r\\nsweep or pave the streets, and split your kindlings, and the teamster\\r\\nshelter himself and his lading against sun wind and rain behind it,—and\\r\\nthe trader, as a Concord trader once did, hang it up by his door for a\\r\\nsign when he commences business, until at last his oldest customer\\r\\ncannot tell surely whether it be animal, vegetable, or mineral, and yet\\r\\nit shall be as pure as a snowflake, and if it be put into a pot and\\r\\nboiled, will come out an excellent dun fish for a Saturday’s dinner.\\r\\nNext Spanish hides, with the tails still preserving their twist and the\\r\\nangle of elevation they had when the oxen that wore them were careering\\r\\nover the pampas of the Spanish main,—a type of all obstinacy, and\\r\\nevincing how almost hopeless and incurable are all constitutional\\r\\nvices. I confess, that practically speaking, when I have learned a\\r\\nman’s real disposition, I have no hopes of changing it for the better\\r\\nor worse in this state of existence. As the Orientals say, “A cur’s\\r\\ntail may be warmed, and pressed, and bound round with ligatures, and\\r\\nafter a twelve years’ labor bestowed upon it, still it will retain its\\r\\nnatural form.” The only effectual cure for such inveteracies as these\\r\\ntails exhibit is to make glue of them, which I believe is what is\\r\\nusually done with them, and then they will stay put and stick. Here is\\r\\na hogshead of molasses or of brandy directed to John Smith,\\r\\nCuttingsville, Vermont, some trader among the Green Mountains, who\\r\\nimports for the farmers near his clearing, and now perchance stands\\r\\nover his bulk-head and thinks of the last arrivals on the coast, how\\r\\nthey may affect the price for him, telling his customers this moment,\\r\\nas he has told them twenty times before this morning, that he expects\\r\\nsome by the next train of prime quality. It is advertised in the\\r\\nCuttingsville Times.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile these things go up other things come down. Warned by the whizzing\\r\\nsound, I look up from my book and see some tall pine, hewn on far\\r\\nnorthern hills, which has winged its way over the Green Mountains and\\r\\nthe Connecticut, shot like an arrow through the township within ten\\r\\nminutes, and scarce another eye beholds it; going\\r\\n\\r\\n     “to be the mast\\r\\n     Of some great ammiral.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd hark! here comes the cattle-train bearing the cattle of a thousand\\r\\nhills, sheepcots, stables, and cow-yards in the air, drovers with their\\r\\nsticks, and shepherd boys in the midst of their flocks, all but the\\r\\nmountain pastures, whirled along like leaves blown from the mountains\\r\\nby the September gales. The air is filled with the bleating of calves\\r\\nand sheep, and the hustling of oxen, as if a pastoral valley were going\\r\\nby. When the old bell-wether at the head rattles his bell, the\\r\\nmountains do indeed skip like rams and the little hills like lambs. A\\r\\ncar-load of drovers, too, in the midst, on a level with their droves\\r\\nnow, their vocation gone, but still clinging to their useless sticks as\\r\\ntheir badge of office. But their dogs, where are they? It is a stampede\\r\\nto them; they are quite thrown out; they have lost the scent. Methinks\\r\\nI hear them barking behind the Peterboro’ Hills, or panting up the\\r\\nwestern slope of the Green Mountains. They will not be in at the death.\\r\\nTheir vocation, too, is gone. Their fidelity and sagacity are below par\\r\\nnow. They will slink back to their kennels in disgrace, or perchance\\r\\nrun wild and strike a league with the wolf and the fox. So is your\\r\\npastoral life whirled past and away. But the bell rings, and I must get\\r\\noff the track and let the cars go by;—\\r\\n\\r\\n     What’s the railroad to me?\\r\\n     I never go to see\\r\\n     Where it ends.\\r\\n     It fills a few hollows,\\r\\n     And makes banks for the swallows,\\r\\n     It sets the sand a-blowing,\\r\\n     And the blackberries a-growing,\\r\\n\\r\\nbut I cross it like a cart-path in the woods. I will not have my eyes\\r\\nput out and my ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that the cars are gone by and all the restless world with them, and\\r\\nthe fishes in the pond no longer feel their rumbling, I am more alone\\r\\nthan ever. For the rest of the long afternoon, perhaps, my meditations\\r\\nare interrupted only by the faint rattle of a carriage or team along\\r\\nthe distant highway.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, on Sundays, I heard the bells, the Lincoln, Acton, Bedford,\\r\\nor Concord bell, when the wind was favorable, a faint, sweet, and, as\\r\\nit were, natural melody, worth importing into the wilderness. At a\\r\\nsufficient distance over the woods this sound acquires a certain\\r\\nvibratory hum, as if the pine needles in the horizon were the strings\\r\\nof a harp which it swept. All sound heard at the greatest possible\\r\\ndistance produces one and the same effect, a vibration of the universal\\r\\nlyre, just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth\\r\\ninteresting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to it. There came\\r\\nto me in this case a melody which the air had strained, and which had\\r\\nconversed with every leaf and needle of the wood, that portion of the\\r\\nsound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed from\\r\\nvale to vale. The echo is, to some extent, an original sound, and\\r\\ntherein is the magic and charm of it. It is not merely a repetition of\\r\\nwhat was worth repeating in the bell, but partly the voice of the wood;\\r\\nthe same trivial words and notes sung by a wood-nymph.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt evening, the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond the\\r\\nwoods sounded sweet and melodious, and at first I would mistake it for\\r\\nthe voices of certain minstrels by whom I was sometimes serenaded, who\\r\\nmight be straying over hill and dale; but soon I was not unpleasantly\\r\\ndisappointed when it was prolonged into the cheap and natural music of\\r\\nthe cow. I do not mean to be satirical, but to express my appreciation\\r\\nof those youths’ singing, when I state that I perceived clearly that it\\r\\nwas akin to the music of the cow, and they were at length one\\r\\narticulation of Nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegularly at half past seven, in one part of the summer, after the\\r\\nevening train had gone by, the whippoorwills chanted their vespers for\\r\\nhalf an hour, sitting on a stump by my door, or upon the ridge pole of\\r\\nthe house. They would begin to sing almost with as much precision as a\\r\\nclock, within five minutes of a particular time, referred to the\\r\\nsetting of the sun, every evening. I had a rare opportunity to become\\r\\nacquainted with their habits. Sometimes I heard four or five at once in\\r\\ndifferent parts of the wood, by accident one a bar behind another, and\\r\\nso near me that I distinguished not only the cluck after each note, but\\r\\noften that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spider’s web, only\\r\\nproportionally louder. Sometimes one would circle round and round me in\\r\\nthe woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string, when probably\\r\\nI was near its eggs. They sang at intervals throughout the night, and\\r\\nwere again as musical as ever just before and about dawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen other birds are still the screech owls take up the strain, like\\r\\nmourning women their ancient u-lu-lu. Their dismal scream is truly Ben\\r\\nJonsonian. Wise midnight hags! It is no honest and blunt tu-whit tu-who\\r\\nof the poets, but, without jesting, a most solemn graveyard ditty, the\\r\\nmutual consolations of suicide lovers remembering the pangs and the\\r\\ndelights of supernal love in the infernal groves. Yet I love to hear\\r\\ntheir wailing, their doleful responses, trilled along the wood-side;\\r\\nreminding me sometimes of music and singing birds; as if it were the\\r\\ndark and tearful side of music, the regrets and sighs that would fain\\r\\nbe sung. They are the spirits, the low spirits and melancholy\\r\\nforebodings, of fallen souls that once in human shape night-walked the\\r\\nearth and did the deeds of darkness, now expiating their sins with\\r\\ntheir wailing hymns or threnodies in the scenery of their\\r\\ntransgressions. They give me a new sense of the variety and capacity of\\r\\nthat nature which is our common dwelling. _Oh-o-o-o-o that I never had\\r\\nbeen bor-r-r-r-n!_ sighs one on this side of the pond, and circles with\\r\\nthe restlessness of despair to some new perch on the gray oaks.\\r\\nThen—_that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n!_ echoes another on the farther\\r\\nside with tremulous sincerity, and—_bor-r-r-r-n!_ comes faintly from\\r\\nfar in the Lincoln woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was also serenaded by a hooting owl. Near at hand you could fancy it\\r\\nthe most melancholy sound in Nature, as if she meant by this to\\r\\nstereotype and make permanent in her choir the dying moans of a human\\r\\nbeing,—some poor weak relic of mortality who has left hope behind, and\\r\\nhowls like an animal, yet with human sobs, on entering the dark valley,\\r\\nmade more awful by a certain gurgling melodiousness,—I find myself\\r\\nbeginning with the letters gl when I try to imitate it,—expressive of a\\r\\nmind which has reached the gelatinous mildewy stage in the\\r\\nmortification of all healthy and courageous thought. It reminded me of\\r\\nghouls and idiots and insane howlings. But now one answers from far\\r\\nwoods in a strain made really melodious by distance,—_Hoo hoo hoo,\\r\\nhoorer hoo_; and indeed for the most part it suggested only pleasing\\r\\nassociations, whether heard by day or night, summer or winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nI rejoice that there are owls. Let them do the idiotic and maniacal\\r\\nhooting for men. It is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilight\\r\\nwoods which no day illustrates, suggesting a vast and undeveloped\\r\\nnature which men have not recognized. They represent the stark twilight\\r\\nand unsatisfied thoughts which all have. All day the sun has shone on\\r\\nthe surface of some savage swamp, where the single spruce stands hung\\r\\nwith usnea lichens, and small hawks circulate above, and the chickadee\\r\\nlisps amid the evergreens, and the partridge and rabbit skulk beneath;\\r\\nbut now a more dismal and fitting day dawns, and a different race of\\r\\ncreatures awakes to express the meaning of Nature there.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in the evening I heard the distant rumbling of wagons over\\r\\nbridges,—a sound heard farther than almost any other at night,—the\\r\\nbaying of dogs, and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow\\r\\nin a distant barn-yard. In the mean while all the shore rang with the\\r\\ntrump of bullfrogs, the sturdy spirits of ancient wine-bibbers and\\r\\nwassailers, still unrepentant, trying to sing a catch in their Stygian\\r\\nlake,—if the Walden nymphs will pardon the comparison, for though there\\r\\nare almost no weeds, there are frogs there,—who would fain keep up the\\r\\nhilarious rules of their old festal tables, though their voices have\\r\\nwaxed hoarse and solemnly grave, mocking at mirth, and the wine has\\r\\nlost its flavor, and become only liquor to distend their paunches, and\\r\\nsweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the past, but\\r\\nmere saturation and waterloggedness and distention. The most\\r\\naldermanic, with his chin upon a heart-leaf, which serves for a napkin\\r\\nto his drooling chaps, under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught\\r\\nof the once scorned water, and passes round the cup with the\\r\\nejaculation _tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk!_ and straightway\\r\\ncomes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeated,\\r\\nwhere the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark; and\\r\\nwhen this observance has made the circuit of the shores, then\\r\\nejaculates the master of ceremonies, with satisfaction, _tr-r-r-oonk!_\\r\\nand each in his turn repeats the same down to the least distended,\\r\\nleakiest, and flabbiest paunched, that there be no mistake; and then\\r\\nthe bowl goes round again and again, until the sun disperses the\\r\\nmorning mist, and only the patriarch is not under the pond, but vainly\\r\\nbellowing _troonk_ from time to time, and pausing for a reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not sure that I ever heard the sound of cock-crowing from my\\r\\nclearing, and I thought that it might be worth the while to keep a\\r\\ncockerel for his music merely, as a singing bird. The note of this once\\r\\nwild Indian pheasant is certainly the most remarkable of any bird’s,\\r\\nand if they could be naturalized without being domesticated, it would\\r\\nsoon become the most famous sound in our woods, surpassing the clangor\\r\\nof the goose and the hooting of the owl; and then imagine the cackling\\r\\nof the hens to fill the pauses when their lords’ clarions rested! No\\r\\nwonder that man added this bird to his tame stock,—to say nothing of\\r\\nthe eggs and drumsticks. To walk in a winter morning in a wood where\\r\\nthese birds abounded, their native woods, and hear the wild cockerels\\r\\ncrow on the trees, clear and shrill for miles over the resounding\\r\\nearth, drowning the feebler notes of other birds,—think of it! It would\\r\\nput nations on the alert. Who would not be early to rise, and rise\\r\\nearlier and earlier every successive day of his life, till he became\\r\\nunspeakably healthy, wealthy, and wise? This foreign bird’s note is\\r\\ncelebrated by the poets of all countries along with the notes of their\\r\\nnative songsters. All climates agree with brave Chanticleer. He is more\\r\\nindigenous even than the natives. His health is ever good, his lungs\\r\\nare sound, his spirits never flag. Even the sailor on the Atlantic and\\r\\nPacific is awakened by his voice; but its shrill sound never roused me\\r\\nfrom my slumbers. I kept neither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that\\r\\nyou would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds; neither\\r\\nthe churn, nor the spinning wheel, nor even the singing of the kettle,\\r\\nnor the hissing of the urn, nor children crying, to comfort one. An\\r\\nold-fashioned man would have lost his senses or died of ennui before\\r\\nthis. Not even rats in the wall, for they were starved out, or rather\\r\\nwere never baited in,—only squirrels on the roof and under the floor, a\\r\\nwhippoorwill on the ridge pole, a blue-jay screaming beneath the\\r\\nwindow, a hare or woodchuck under the house, a screech-owl or a cat-owl\\r\\nbehind it, a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond, and a\\r\\nfox to bark in the night. Not even a lark or an oriole, those mild\\r\\nplantation birds, ever visited my clearing. No cockerels to crow nor\\r\\nhens to cackle in the yard. No yard! but unfenced Nature reaching up to\\r\\nyour very sills. A young forest growing up under your meadows, and wild\\r\\nsumachs and blackberry vines breaking through into your cellar; sturdy\\r\\npitch pines rubbing and creaking against the shingles for want of room,\\r\\ntheir roots reaching quite under the house. Instead of a scuttle or a\\r\\nblind blown off in the gale,—a pine tree snapped off or torn up by the\\r\\nroots behind your house for fuel. Instead of no path to the front-yard\\r\\ngate in the Great Snow,—no gate,—no front-yard,—and no path to the\\r\\ncivilized world!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSolitude\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a delicious evening, when the whole body is one sense, and\\r\\nimbibes delight through every pore. I go and come with a strange\\r\\nliberty in Nature, a part of herself. As I walk along the stony shore\\r\\nof the pond in my shirt sleeves, though it is cool as well as cloudy\\r\\nand windy, and I see nothing special to attract me, all the elements\\r\\nare unusually congenial to me. The bullfrogs trump to usher in the\\r\\nnight, and the note of the whippoorwill is borne on the rippling wind\\r\\nfrom over the water. Sympathy with the fluttering alder and poplar\\r\\nleaves almost takes away my breath; yet, like the lake, my serenity is\\r\\nrippled but not ruffled. These small waves raised by the evening wind\\r\\nare as remote from storm as the smooth reflecting surface. Though it is\\r\\nnow dark, the wind still blows and roars in the wood, the waves still\\r\\ndash, and some creatures lull the rest with their notes. The repose is\\r\\nnever complete. The wildest animals do not repose, but seek their prey\\r\\nnow; the fox, and skunk, and rabbit, now roam the fields and woods\\r\\nwithout fear. They are Nature’s watchmen,—links which connect the days\\r\\nof animated life.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I return to my house I find that visitors have been there and left\\r\\ntheir cards, either a bunch of flowers, or a wreath of evergreen, or a\\r\\nname in pencil on a yellow walnut leaf or a chip. They who come rarely\\r\\nto the woods take some little piece of the forest into their hands to\\r\\nplay with by the way, which they leave, either intentionally or\\r\\naccidentally. One has peeled a willow wand, woven it into a ring, and\\r\\ndropped it on my table. I could always tell if visitors had called in\\r\\nmy absence, either by the bended twigs or grass, or the print of their\\r\\nshoes, and generally of what sex or age or quality they were by some\\r\\nslight trace left, as a flower dropped, or a bunch of grass plucked and\\r\\nthrown away, even as far off as the railroad, half a mile distant, or\\r\\nby the lingering odor of a cigar or pipe. Nay, I was frequently\\r\\nnotified of the passage of a traveller along the highway sixty rods off\\r\\nby the scent of his pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is commonly sufficient space about us. Our horizon is never quite\\r\\nat our elbows. The thick wood is not just at our door, nor the pond,\\r\\nbut somewhat is always clearing, familiar and worn by us, appropriated\\r\\nand fenced in some way, and reclaimed from Nature. For what reason have\\r\\nI this vast range and circuit, some square miles of unfrequented\\r\\nforest, for my privacy, abandoned to me by men? My nearest neighbor is\\r\\na mile distant, and no house is visible from any place but the\\r\\nhill-tops within half a mile of my own. I have my horizon bounded by\\r\\nwoods all to myself; a distant view of the railroad where it touches\\r\\nthe pond on the one hand, and of the fence which skirts the woodland\\r\\nroad on the other. But for the most part it is as solitary where I live\\r\\nas on the prairies. It is as much Asia or Africa as New England. I\\r\\nhave, as it were, my own sun and moon and stars, and a little world all\\r\\nto myself. At night there was never a traveller passed my house, or\\r\\nknocked at my door, more than if I were the first or last man; unless\\r\\nit were in the spring, when at long intervals some came from the\\r\\nvillage to fish for pouts,—they plainly fished much more in the Walden\\r\\nPond of their own natures, and baited their hooks with darkness,—but\\r\\nthey soon retreated, usually with light baskets, and left “the world to\\r\\ndarkness and to me,” and the black kernel of the night was never\\r\\nprofaned by any human neighborhood. I believe that men are generally\\r\\nstill a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung, and\\r\\nChristianity and candles have been introduced.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet I experienced sometimes that the most sweet and tender, the most\\r\\ninnocent and encouraging society may be found in any natural object,\\r\\neven for the poor misanthrope and most melancholy man. There can be no\\r\\nvery black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of Nature and has\\r\\nhis senses still. There was never yet such a storm but it was Æolian\\r\\nmusic to a healthy and innocent ear. Nothing can rightly compel a\\r\\nsimple and brave man to a vulgar sadness. While I enjoy the friendship\\r\\nof the seasons I trust that nothing can make life a burden to me. The\\r\\ngentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house to-day is\\r\\nnot drear and melancholy, but good for me too. Though it prevents my\\r\\nhoeing them, it is of far more worth than my hoeing. If it should\\r\\ncontinue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy\\r\\nthe potatoes in the low lands, it would still be good for the grass on\\r\\nthe uplands, and, being good for the grass, it would be good for me.\\r\\nSometimes, when I compare myself with other men, it seems as if I were\\r\\nmore favored by the gods than they, beyond any deserts that I am\\r\\nconscious of; as if I had a warrant and surety at their hands which my\\r\\nfellows have not, and were especially guided and guarded. I do not\\r\\nflatter myself, but if it be possible they flatter me. I have never\\r\\nfelt lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude, but\\r\\nonce, and that was a few weeks after I came to the woods, when, for an\\r\\nhour, I doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a\\r\\nserene and healthy life. To be alone was something unpleasant. But I\\r\\nwas at the same time conscious of a slight insanity in my mood, and\\r\\nseemed to foresee my recovery. In the midst of a gentle rain while\\r\\nthese thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such sweet and\\r\\nbeneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and\\r\\nin every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable\\r\\nfriendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the\\r\\nfancied advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have\\r\\nnever thought of them since. Every little pine needle expanded and\\r\\nswelled with sympathy and befriended me. I was so distinctly made aware\\r\\nof the presence of something kindred to me, even in scenes which we are\\r\\naccustomed to call wild and dreary, and also that the nearest of blood\\r\\nto me and humanest was not a person nor a villager, that I thought no\\r\\nplace could ever be strange to me again.—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Mourning untimely consumes the sad;\\r\\n     Few are their days in the land of the living,\\r\\n     Beautiful daughter of Toscar.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of my pleasantest hours were during the long rain storms in the\\r\\nspring or fall, which confined me to the house for the afternoon as\\r\\nwell as the forenoon, soothed by their ceaseless roar and pelting; when\\r\\nan early twilight ushered in a long evening in which many thoughts had\\r\\ntime to take root and unfold themselves. In those driving north-east\\r\\nrains which tried the village houses so, when the maids stood ready\\r\\nwith mop and pail in front entries to keep the deluge out, I sat behind\\r\\nmy door in my little house, which was all entry, and thoroughly enjoyed\\r\\nits protection. In one heavy thunder shower the lightning struck a\\r\\nlarge pitch-pine across the pond, making a very conspicuous and\\r\\nperfectly regular spiral groove from top to bottom, an inch or more\\r\\ndeep, and four or five inches wide, as you would groove a\\r\\nwalking-stick. I passed it again the other day, and was struck with awe\\r\\non looking up and beholding that mark, now more distinct than ever,\\r\\nwhere a terrific and resistless bolt came down out of the harmless sky\\r\\neight years ago. Men frequently say to me, “I should think you would\\r\\nfeel lonesome down there, and want to be nearer to folks, rainy and\\r\\nsnowy days and nights especially.” I am tempted to reply to such,—This\\r\\nwhole earth which we inhabit is but a point in space. How far apart,\\r\\nthink you, dwell the two most distant inhabitants of yonder star, the\\r\\nbreadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our instruments? Why\\r\\nshould I feel lonely? is not our planet in the Milky Way? This which\\r\\nyou put seems to me not to be the most important question. What sort of\\r\\nspace is that which separates a man from his fellows and makes him\\r\\nsolitary? I have found that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds\\r\\nmuch nearer to one another. What do we want most to dwell near to? Not\\r\\nto many men surely, the depot, the post-office, the bar-room, the\\r\\nmeeting-house, the school-house, the grocery, Beacon Hill, or the Five\\r\\nPoints, where men most congregate, but to the perennial source of our\\r\\nlife, whence in all our experience we have found that to issue, as the\\r\\nwillow stands near the water and sends out its roots in that direction.\\r\\nThis will vary with different natures, but this is the place where a\\r\\nwise man will dig his cellar.... I one evening overtook one of my\\r\\ntownsmen, who has accumulated what is called “a handsome\\r\\nproperty,”—though I never got a _fair_ view of it,—on the Walden road,\\r\\ndriving a pair of cattle to market, who inquired of me how I could\\r\\nbring my mind to give up so many of the comforts of life. I answered\\r\\nthat I was very sure I liked it passably well; I was not joking. And so\\r\\nI went home to my bed, and left him to pick his way through the\\r\\ndarkness and the mud to Brighton,—or Bright-town,—which place he would\\r\\nreach some time in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny prospect of awakening or coming to life to a dead man makes\\r\\nindifferent all times and places. The place where that may occur is\\r\\nalways the same, and indescribably pleasant to all our senses. For the\\r\\nmost part we allow only outlying and transient circumstances to make\\r\\nour occasions. They are, in fact, the cause of our distraction. Nearest\\r\\nto all things is that power which fashions their being. _Next_ to us\\r\\nthe grandest laws are continually being executed. _Next_ to us is not\\r\\nthe workman whom we have hired, with whom we love so well to talk, but\\r\\nthe workman whose work we are.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How vast and profound is the influence of the subtile powers of Heaven\\r\\nand of Earth!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We seek to perceive them, and we do not see them; we seek to hear\\r\\nthem, and we do not hear them; identified with the substance of things,\\r\\nthey cannot be separated from them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They cause that in all the universe men purify and sanctify their\\r\\nhearts, and clothe themselves in their holiday garments to offer\\r\\nsacrifices and oblations to their ancestors. It is an ocean of subtile\\r\\nintelligences. They are every where, above us, on our left, on our\\r\\nright; they environ us on all sides.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are the subjects of an experiment which is not a little interesting\\r\\nto me. Can we not do without the society of our gossips a little while\\r\\nunder these circumstances,—have our own thoughts to cheer us? Confucius\\r\\nsays truly, “Virtue does not remain as an abandoned orphan; it must of\\r\\nnecessity have neighbors.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith thinking we may be beside ourselves in a sane sense. By a\\r\\nconscious effort of the mind we can stand aloof from actions and their\\r\\nconsequences; and all things, good and bad, go by us like a torrent. We\\r\\nare not wholly involved in Nature. I may be either the drift-wood in\\r\\nthe stream, or Indra in the sky looking down on it. I _may_ be affected\\r\\nby a theatrical exhibition; on the other hand, I _may not_ be affected\\r\\nby an actual event which appears to concern me much more. I only know\\r\\nmyself as a human entity; the scene, so to speak, of thoughts and\\r\\naffections; and am sensible of a certain doubleness by which I can\\r\\nstand as remote from myself as from another. However intense my\\r\\nexperience, I am conscious of the presence and criticism of a part of\\r\\nme, which, as it were, is not a part of me, but spectator, sharing no\\r\\nexperience, but taking note of it; and that is no more I than it is\\r\\nyou. When the play, it may be the tragedy, of life is over, the\\r\\nspectator goes his way. It was a kind of fiction, a work of the\\r\\nimagination only, so far as he was concerned. This doubleness may\\r\\neasily make us poor neighbors and friends sometimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in\\r\\ncompany, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love\\r\\nto be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as\\r\\nsolitude. We are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among\\r\\nmen than when we stay in our chambers. A man thinking or working is\\r\\nalways alone, let him be where he will. Solitude is not measured by the\\r\\nmiles of space that intervene between a man and his fellows. The really\\r\\ndiligent student in one of the crowded hives of Cambridge College is as\\r\\nsolitary as a dervish in the desert. The farmer can work alone in the\\r\\nfield or the woods all day, hoeing or chopping, and not feel lonesome,\\r\\nbecause he is employed; but when he comes home at night he cannot sit\\r\\ndown in a room alone, at the mercy of his thoughts, but must be where\\r\\nhe can “see the folks,” and recreate, and as he thinks remunerate\\r\\nhimself for his day’s solitude; and hence he wonders how the student\\r\\ncan sit alone in the house all night and most of the day without ennui\\r\\nand “the blues;” but he does not realize that the student, though in\\r\\nthe house, is still at work in _his_ field, and chopping in _his_\\r\\nwoods, as the farmer in his, and in turn seeks the same recreation and\\r\\nsociety that the latter does, though it may be a more condensed form of\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSociety is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not\\r\\nhaving had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at\\r\\nmeals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old\\r\\nmusty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of\\r\\nrules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting\\r\\ntolerable and that we need not come to open war. We meet at the\\r\\npost-office, and at the sociable, and about the fireside every night;\\r\\nwe live thick and are in each other’s way, and stumble over one\\r\\nanother, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another.\\r\\nCertainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty\\r\\ncommunications. Consider the girls in a factory,—never alone, hardly in\\r\\ntheir dreams. It would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a\\r\\nsquare mile, as where I live. The value of a man is not in his skin,\\r\\nthat we should touch him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have heard of a man lost in the woods and dying of famine and\\r\\nexhaustion at the foot of a tree, whose loneliness was relieved by the\\r\\ngrotesque visions with which, owing to bodily weakness, his diseased\\r\\nimagination surrounded him, and which he believed to be real. So also,\\r\\nowing to bodily and mental health and strength, we may be continually\\r\\ncheered by a like but more normal and natural society, and come to know\\r\\nthat we are never alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a great deal of company in my house; especially in the morning,\\r\\nwhen nobody calls. Let me suggest a few comparisons, that some one may\\r\\nconvey an idea of my situation. I am no more lonely than the loon in\\r\\nthe pond that laughs so loud, or than Walden Pond itself. What company\\r\\nhas that lonely lake, I pray? And yet it has not the blue devils, but\\r\\nthe blue angels in it, in the azure tint of its waters. The sun is\\r\\nalone, except in thick weather, when there sometimes appear to be two,\\r\\nbut one is a mock sun. God is alone,—but the devil, he is far from\\r\\nbeing alone; he sees a great deal of company; he is legion. I am no\\r\\nmore lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a pasture, or a bean\\r\\nleaf, or sorrel, or a horse-fly, or a bumble-bee. I am no more lonely\\r\\nthan the Mill Brook, or a weathercock, or the north star, or the south\\r\\nwind, or an April shower, or a January thaw, or the first spider in a\\r\\nnew house.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have occasional visits in the long winter evenings, when the snow\\r\\nfalls fast and the wind howls in the wood, from an old settler and\\r\\noriginal proprietor, who is reported to have dug Walden Pond, and\\r\\nstoned it, and fringed it with pine woods; who tells me stories of old\\r\\ntime and of new eternity; and between us we manage to pass a cheerful\\r\\nevening with social mirth and pleasant views of things, even without\\r\\napples or cider,—a most wise and humorous friend, whom I love much, who\\r\\nkeeps himself more secret than ever did Goffe or Whalley; and though he\\r\\nis thought to be dead, none can show where he is buried. An elderly\\r\\ndame, too, dwells in my neighborhood, invisible to most persons, in\\r\\nwhose odorous herb garden I love to stroll sometimes, gathering simples\\r\\nand listening to her fables; for she has a genius of unequalled\\r\\nfertility, and her memory runs back farther than mythology, and she can\\r\\ntell me the original of every fable, and on what fact every one is\\r\\nfounded, for the incidents occurred when she was young. A ruddy and\\r\\nlusty old dame, who delights in all weathers and seasons, and is likely\\r\\nto outlive all her children yet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indescribable innocence and beneficence of Nature,—of sun and wind\\r\\nand rain, of summer and winter,—such health, such cheer, they afford\\r\\nforever! and such sympathy have they ever with our race, that all\\r\\nNature would be affected, and the sun’s brightness fade, and the winds\\r\\nwould sigh humanely, and the clouds rain tears, and the woods shed\\r\\ntheir leaves and put on mourning in midsummer, if any man should ever\\r\\nfor a just cause grieve. Shall I not have intelligence with the earth?\\r\\nAm I not partly leaves and vegetable mould myself?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the pill which will keep us well, serene, contented? Not my or\\r\\nthy great-grandfather’s, but our great-grandmother Nature’s universal,\\r\\nvegetable, botanic medicines, by which she has kept herself young\\r\\nalways, outlived so many old Parrs in her day, and fed her health with\\r\\ntheir decaying fatness. For my panacea, instead of one of those quack\\r\\nvials of a mixture dipped from Acheron and the Dead Sea, which come out\\r\\nof those long shallow black-schooner looking wagons which we sometimes\\r\\nsee made to carry bottles, let me have a draught of undiluted morning\\r\\nair. Morning air! If men will not drink of this at the fountain-head of\\r\\nthe day, why, then, we must even bottle up some and sell it in the\\r\\nshops, for the benefit of those who have lost their subscription ticket\\r\\nto morning time in this world. But remember, it will not keep quite\\r\\ntill noon-day even in the coolest cellar, but drive out the stopples\\r\\nlong ere that and follow westward the steps of Aurora. I am no\\r\\nworshipper of Hygeia, who was the daughter of that old herb-doctor\\r\\nÆsculapius, and who is represented on monuments holding a serpent in\\r\\none hand, and in the other a cup out of which the serpent sometimes\\r\\ndrinks; but rather of Hebe, cupbearer to Jupiter, who was the daughter\\r\\nof Juno and wild lettuce, and who had the power of restoring gods and\\r\\nmen to the vigor of youth. She was probably the only thoroughly\\r\\nsound-conditioned, healthy, and robust young lady that ever walked the\\r\\nglobe, and wherever she came it was spring.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVisitors\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that I love society as much as most, and am ready enough to\\r\\nfasten myself like a bloodsucker for the time to any full-blooded man\\r\\nthat comes in my way. I am naturally no hermit, but might possibly sit\\r\\nout the sturdiest frequenter of the bar-room, if my business called me\\r\\nthither.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship,\\r\\nthree for society. When visitors came in larger and unexpected numbers\\r\\nthere was but the third chair for them all, but they generally\\r\\neconomized the room by standing up. It is surprising how many great men\\r\\nand women a small house will contain. I have had twenty-five or thirty\\r\\nsouls, with their bodies, at once under my roof, and yet we often\\r\\nparted without being aware that we had come very near to one another.\\r\\nMany of our houses, both public and private, with their almost\\r\\ninnumerable apartments, their huge halls and their cellars for the\\r\\nstorage of wines and other munitions of peace, appear to me\\r\\nextravagantly large for their inhabitants. They are so vast and\\r\\nmagnificent that the latter seem to be only vermin which infest them. I\\r\\nam surprised when the herald blows his summons before some Tremont or\\r\\nAstor or Middlesex House, to see come creeping out over the piazza for\\r\\nall inhabitants a ridiculous mouse, which soon again slinks into some\\r\\nhole in the pavement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne inconvenience I sometimes experienced in so small a house, the\\r\\ndifficulty of getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we\\r\\nbegan to utter the big thoughts in big words. You want room for your\\r\\nthoughts to get into sailing trim and run a course or two before they\\r\\nmake their port. The bullet of your thought must have overcome its\\r\\nlateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its last and steady course\\r\\nbefore it reaches the ear of the hearer, else it may plough out again\\r\\nthrough the side of his head. Also, our sentences wanted room to unfold\\r\\nand form their columns in the interval. Individuals, like nations, must\\r\\nhave suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a considerable neutral\\r\\nground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk across\\r\\nthe pond to a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so\\r\\nnear that we could not begin to hear,—we could not speak low enough to\\r\\nbe heard; as when you throw two stones into calm water so near that\\r\\nthey break each other’s undulations. If we are merely loquacious and\\r\\nloud talkers, then we can afford to stand very near together, cheek by\\r\\njowl, and feel each other’s breath; but if we speak reservedly and\\r\\nthoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that all animal heat and\\r\\nmoisture may have a chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy the most\\r\\nintimate society with that in each of us which is without, or above,\\r\\nbeing spoken to, we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart\\r\\nbodily that we cannot possibly hear each other’s voice in any case.\\r\\nReferred to this standard, speech is for the convenience of those who\\r\\nare hard of hearing; but there are many fine things which we cannot say\\r\\nif we have to shout. As the conversation began to assume a loftier and\\r\\ngrander tone, we gradually shoved our chairs farther apart till they\\r\\ntouched the wall in opposite corners, and then commonly there was not\\r\\nroom enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy “best” room, however, my withdrawing room, always ready for company,\\r\\non whose carpet the sun rarely fell, was the pine wood behind my house.\\r\\nThither in summer days, when distinguished guests came, I took them,\\r\\nand a priceless domestic swept the floor and dusted the furniture and\\r\\nkept the things in order.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one guest came he sometimes partook of my frugal meal, and it was no\\r\\ninterruption to conversation to be stirring a hasty-pudding, or\\r\\nwatching the rising and maturing of a loaf of bread in the ashes, in\\r\\nthe mean while. But if twenty came and sat in my house there was\\r\\nnothing said about dinner, though there might be bread enough for two,\\r\\nmore than if eating were a forsaken habit; but we naturally practised\\r\\nabstinence; and this was never felt to be an offence against\\r\\nhospitality, but the most proper and considerate course. The waste and\\r\\ndecay of physical life, which so often needs repair, seemed\\r\\nmiraculously retarded in such a case, and the vital vigor stood its\\r\\nground. I could entertain thus a thousand as well as twenty; and if any\\r\\never went away disappointed or hungry from my house when they found me\\r\\nat home, they may depend upon it that I sympathized with them at least.\\r\\nSo easy is it, though many housekeepers doubt it, to establish new and\\r\\nbetter customs in the place of the old. You need not rest your\\r\\nreputation on the dinners you give. For my own part, I was never so\\r\\neffectually deterred from frequenting a man’s house, by any kind of\\r\\nCerberus whatever, as by the parade one made about dining me, which I\\r\\ntook to be a very polite and roundabout hint never to trouble him so\\r\\nagain. I think I shall never revisit those scenes. I should be proud to\\r\\nhave for the motto of my cabin those lines of Spenser which one of my\\r\\nvisitors inscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card:—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Arrivéd there, the little house they fill,\\r\\n         Ne looke for entertainment where none was;\\r\\n     Rest is their feast, and all things at their will:\\r\\n         The noblest mind the best contentment has.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Winslow, afterward governor of the Plymouth Colony, went with a\\r\\ncompanion on a visit of ceremony to Massasoit on foot through the\\r\\nwoods, and arrived tired and hungry at his lodge, they were well\\r\\nreceived by the king, but nothing was said about eating that day. When\\r\\nthe night arrived, to quote their own words,—“He laid us on the bed\\r\\nwith himself and his wife, they at the one end and we at the other, it\\r\\nbeing only planks laid a foot from the ground, and a thin mat upon\\r\\nthem. Two more of his chief men, for want of room, pressed by and upon\\r\\nus; so that we were worse weary of our lodging than of our journey.” At\\r\\none o’clock the next day Massasoit “brought two fishes that he had\\r\\nshot,” about thrice as big as a bream; “these being boiled, there were\\r\\nat least forty looked for a share in them. The most ate of them. This\\r\\nmeal only we had in two nights and a day; and had not one of us bought\\r\\na partridge, we had taken our journey fasting.” Fearing that they would\\r\\nbe light-headed for want of food and also sleep, owing to “the savages’\\r\\nbarbarous singing, (for they used to sing themselves asleep,)” and that\\r\\nthey might get home while they had strength to travel, they departed.\\r\\nAs for lodging, it is true they were but poorly entertained, though\\r\\nwhat they found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honor;\\r\\nbut as far as eating was concerned, I do not see how the Indians could\\r\\nhave done better. They had nothing to eat themselves, and they were\\r\\nwiser than to think that apologies could supply the place of food to\\r\\ntheir guests; so they drew their belts tighter and said nothing about\\r\\nit. Another time when Winslow visited them, it being a season of plenty\\r\\nwith them, there was no deficiency in this respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for men, they will hardly fail one any where. I had more visitors\\r\\nwhile I lived in the woods than at any other period in my life; I mean\\r\\nthat I had some. I met several there under more favorable circumstances\\r\\nthan I could any where else. But fewer came to see me on trivial\\r\\nbusiness. In this respect, my company was winnowed by my mere distance\\r\\nfrom town. I had withdrawn so far within the great ocean of solitude,\\r\\ninto which the rivers of society empty, that for the most part, so far\\r\\nas my needs were concerned, only the finest sediment was deposited\\r\\naround me. Beside, there were wafted to me evidences of unexplored and\\r\\nuncultivated continents on the other side.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho should come to my lodge this morning but a true Homeric or\\r\\nPaphlagonian man,—he had so suitable and poetic a name that I am sorry\\r\\nI cannot print it here,—a Canadian, a woodchopper and post-maker, who\\r\\ncan hole fifty posts in a day, who made his last supper on a woodchuck\\r\\nwhich his dog caught. He, too, has heard of Homer, and, “if it were not\\r\\nfor books,” would “not know what to do rainy days,” though perhaps he\\r\\nhas not read one wholly through for many rainy seasons. Some priest who\\r\\ncould pronounce the Greek itself taught him to read his verse in the\\r\\ntestament in his native parish far away; and now I must translate to\\r\\nhim, while he holds the book, Achilles’ reproof to Patroclus for his\\r\\nsad countenance.—“Why are you in tears, Patroclus, like a young girl?”—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Or have you alone heard some news from Phthia?\\r\\n     They say that Menœtius lives yet, son of Actor,\\r\\n     And Peleus lives, son of Æacus, among the Myrmidons,\\r\\n     Either of whom having died, we should greatly grieve.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe says, “That’s good.” He has a great bundle of white-oak bark under\\r\\nhis arm for a sick man, gathered this Sunday morning. “I suppose\\r\\nthere’s no harm in going after such a thing to-day,” says he. To him\\r\\nHomer was a great writer, though what his writing was about he did not\\r\\nknow. A more simple and natural man it would be hard to find. Vice and\\r\\ndisease, which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world, seemed to\\r\\nhave hardly any existence for him. He was about twenty-eight years old,\\r\\nand had left Canada and his father’s house a dozen years before to work\\r\\nin the States, and earn money to buy a farm with at last, perhaps in\\r\\nhis native country. He was cast in the coarsest mould; a stout but\\r\\nsluggish body, yet gracefully carried, with a thick sunburnt neck, dark\\r\\nbushy hair, and dull sleepy blue eyes, which were occasionally lit up\\r\\nwith expression. He wore a flat gray cloth cap, a dingy wool-colored\\r\\ngreatcoat, and cowhide boots. He was a great consumer of meat, usually\\r\\ncarrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my house,—for he\\r\\nchopped all summer,—in a tin pail; cold meats, often cold woodchucks,\\r\\nand coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from his belt;\\r\\nand sometimes he offered me a drink. He came along early, crossing my\\r\\nbean-field, though without anxiety or haste to get to his work, such as\\r\\nYankees exhibit. He wasn’t a-going to hurt himself. He didn’t care if\\r\\nhe only earned his board. Frequently he would leave his dinner in the\\r\\nbushes, when his dog had caught a woodchuck by the way, and go back a\\r\\nmile and a half to dress it and leave it in the cellar of the house\\r\\nwhere he boarded, after deliberating first for half an hour whether he\\r\\ncould not sink it in the pond safely till nightfall,—loving to dwell\\r\\nlong upon these themes. He would say, as he went by in the morning,\\r\\n“How thick the pigeons are! If working every day were not my trade, I\\r\\ncould get all the meat I should want by hunting,—pigeons, woodchucks,\\r\\nrabbits, partridges,—by gosh! I could get all I should want for a week\\r\\nin one day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a skilful chopper, and indulged in some flourishes and ornaments\\r\\nin his art. He cut his trees level and close to the ground, that the\\r\\nsprouts which came up afterward might be more vigorous and a sled might\\r\\nslide over the stumps; and instead of leaving a whole tree to support\\r\\nhis corded wood, he would pare it away to a slender stake or splinter\\r\\nwhich you could break off with your hand at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy\\r\\nwithal; a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his\\r\\neyes. His mirth was without alloy. Sometimes I saw him at his work in\\r\\nthe woods, felling trees, and he would greet me with a laugh of\\r\\ninexpressible satisfaction, and a salutation in Canadian French, though\\r\\nhe spoke English as well. When I approached him he would suspend his\\r\\nwork, and with half-suppressed mirth lie along the trunk of a pine\\r\\nwhich he had felled, and, peeling off the inner bark, roll it up into a\\r\\nball and chew it while he laughed and talked. Such an exuberance of\\r\\nanimal spirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the\\r\\nground with laughter at any thing which made him think and tickled him.\\r\\nLooking round upon the trees he would exclaim,—“By George! I can enjoy\\r\\nmyself well enough here chopping; I want no better sport.” Sometimes,\\r\\nwhen at leisure, he amused himself all day in the woods with a pocket\\r\\npistol, firing salutes to himself at regular intervals as he walked. In\\r\\nthe winter he had a fire by which at noon he warmed his coffee in a\\r\\nkettle; and as he sat on a log to eat his dinner the chickadees would\\r\\nsometimes come round and alight on his arm and peck at the potato in\\r\\nhis fingers; and he said that he “liked to have the little _fellers_\\r\\nabout him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn him the animal man chiefly was developed. In physical endurance and\\r\\ncontentment he was cousin to the pine and the rock. I asked him once if\\r\\nhe was not sometimes tired at night, after working all day; and he\\r\\nanswered, with a sincere and serious look, “Gorrappit, I never was\\r\\ntired in my life.” But the intellectual and what is called spiritual\\r\\nman in him were slumbering as in an infant. He had been instructed only\\r\\nin that innocent and ineffectual way in which the Catholic priests\\r\\nteach the aborigines, by which the pupil is never educated to the\\r\\ndegree of consciousness, but only to the degree of trust and reverence,\\r\\nand a child is not made a man, but kept a child. When Nature made him,\\r\\nshe gave him a strong body and contentment for his portion, and propped\\r\\nhim on every side with reverence and reliance, that he might live out\\r\\nhis threescore years and ten a child. He was so genuine and\\r\\nunsophisticated that no introduction would serve to introduce him, more\\r\\nthan if you introduced a woodchuck to your neighbor. He had got to find\\r\\nhim out as you did. He would not play any part. Men paid him wages for\\r\\nwork, and so helped to feed and clothe him; but he never exchanged\\r\\nopinions with them. He was so simply and naturally humble—if he can be\\r\\ncalled humble who never aspires—that humility was no distinct quality\\r\\nin him, nor could he conceive of it. Wiser men were demigods to him. If\\r\\nyou told him that such a one was coming, he did as if he thought that\\r\\nany thing so grand would expect nothing of himself, but take all the\\r\\nresponsibility on itself, and let him be forgotten still. He never\\r\\nheard the sound of praise. He particularly reverenced the writer and\\r\\nthe preacher. Their performances were miracles. When I told him that I\\r\\nwrote considerably, he thought for a long time that it was merely the\\r\\nhandwriting which I meant, for he could write a remarkably good hand\\r\\nhimself. I sometimes found the name of his native parish handsomely\\r\\nwritten in the snow by the highway, with the proper French accent, and\\r\\nknew that he had passed. I asked him if he ever wished to write his\\r\\nthoughts. He said that he had read and written letters for those who\\r\\ncould not, but he never tried to write thoughts,—no, he could not, he\\r\\ncould not tell what to put first, it would kill him, and then there was\\r\\nspelling to be attended to at the same time!\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he did\\r\\nnot want the world to be changed; but he answered with a chuckle of\\r\\nsurprise in his Canadian accent, not knowing that the question had ever\\r\\nbeen entertained before, “No, I like it well enough.” It would have\\r\\nsuggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings with him. To a\\r\\nstranger he appeared to know nothing of things in general; yet I\\r\\nsometimes saw in him a man whom I had not seen before, and I did not\\r\\nknow whether he was as wise as Shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a\\r\\nchild, whether to suspect him of a fine poetic consciousness or of\\r\\nstupidity. A townsman told me that when he met him sauntering through\\r\\nthe village in his small close-fitting cap, and whistling to himself,\\r\\nhe reminded him of a prince in disguise.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis only books were an almanac and an arithmetic, in which last he was\\r\\nconsiderably expert. The former was a sort of cyclopædia to him, which\\r\\nhe supposed to contain an abstract of human knowledge, as indeed it\\r\\ndoes to a considerable extent. I loved to sound him on the various\\r\\nreforms of the day, and he never failed to look at them in the most\\r\\nsimple and practical light. He had never heard of such things before.\\r\\nCould he do without factories? I asked. He had worn the home-made\\r\\nVermont gray, he said, and that was good. Could he dispense with tea\\r\\nand coffee? Did this country afford any beverage beside water? He had\\r\\nsoaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it, and thought that was\\r\\nbetter than water in warm weather. When I asked him if he could do\\r\\nwithout money, he showed the convenience of money in such a way as to\\r\\nsuggest and coincide with the most philosophical accounts of the origin\\r\\nof this institution, and the very derivation of the word _pecunia_. If\\r\\nan ox were his property, and he wished to get needles and thread at the\\r\\nstore, he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on\\r\\nmortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount. He\\r\\ncould defend many institutions better than any philosopher, because, in\\r\\ndescribing them as they concerned him, he gave the true reason for\\r\\ntheir prevalence, and speculation had not suggested to him any other.\\r\\nAt another time, hearing Plato’s definition of a man,—a biped without\\r\\nfeathers,—and that one exhibited a cock plucked and called it Plato’s\\r\\nman, he thought it an important difference that the _knees_ bent the\\r\\nwrong way. He would sometimes exclaim, “How I love to talk! By George,\\r\\nI could talk all day!” I asked him once, when I had not seen him for\\r\\nmany months, if he had got a new idea this summer. “Good Lord,” said\\r\\nhe, “a man that has to work as I do, if he does not forget the ideas he\\r\\nhas had, he will do well. May be the man you hoe with is inclined to\\r\\nrace; then, by gorry, your mind must be there; you think of weeds.” He\\r\\nwould sometimes ask me first on such occasions, if I had made any\\r\\nimprovement. One winter day I asked him if he was always satisfied with\\r\\nhimself, wishing to suggest a substitute within him for the priest\\r\\nwithout, and some higher motive for living. “Satisfied!” said he; “some\\r\\nmen are satisfied with one thing, and some with another. One man,\\r\\nperhaps, if he has got enough, will be satisfied to sit all day with\\r\\nhis back to the fire and his belly to the table, by George!” Yet I\\r\\nnever, by any manœuvring, could get him to take the spiritual view of\\r\\nthings; the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a simple\\r\\nexpediency, such as you might expect an animal to appreciate; and this,\\r\\npractically, is true of most men. If I suggested any improvement in his\\r\\nmode of life, he merely answered, without expressing any regret, that\\r\\nit was too late. Yet he thoroughly believed in honesty and the like\\r\\nvirtues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a certain positive originality, however slight, to be\\r\\ndetected in him, and I occasionally observed that he was thinking for\\r\\nhimself and expressing his own opinion, a phenomenon so rare that I\\r\\nwould any day walk ten miles to observe it, and it amounted to the\\r\\nre-origination of many of the institutions of society. Though he\\r\\nhesitated, and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly, he always\\r\\nhad a presentable thought behind. Yet his thinking was so primitive and\\r\\nimmersed in his animal life, that, though more promising than a merely\\r\\nlearned man’s, it rarely ripened to any thing which can be reported. He\\r\\nsuggested that there might be men of genius in the lowest grades of\\r\\nlife, however permanently humble and illiterate, who take their own\\r\\nview always, or do not pretend to see at all; who are as bottomless\\r\\neven as Walden Pond was thought to be, though they may be dark and\\r\\nmuddy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of my\\r\\nhouse, and, as an excuse for calling, asked for a glass of water. I\\r\\ntold them that I drank at the pond, and pointed thither, offering to\\r\\nlend them a dipper. Far off as I lived, I was not exempted from the\\r\\nannual visitation which occurs, methinks, about the first of April,\\r\\nwhen every body is on the move; and I had my share of good luck, though\\r\\nthere were some curious specimens among my visitors. Half-witted men\\r\\nfrom the almshouse and elsewhere came to see me; but I endeavored to\\r\\nmake them exercise all the wit they had, and make their confessions to\\r\\nme; in such cases making wit the theme of our conversation; and so was\\r\\ncompensated. Indeed, I found some of them to be wiser than the so\\r\\ncalled _overseers_ of the poor and selectmen of the town, and thought\\r\\nit was time that the tables were turned. With respect to wit, I learned\\r\\nthat there was not much difference between the half and the whole. One\\r\\nday, in particular, an inoffensive, simple-minded pauper, whom with\\r\\nothers I had often seen used as fencing stuff, standing or sitting on a\\r\\nbushel in the fields to keep cattle and himself from straying, visited\\r\\nme, and expressed a wish to live as I did. He told me, with the utmost\\r\\nsimplicity and truth, quite superior, or rather _inferior_, to any\\r\\nthing that is called humility, that he was “deficient in intellect.”\\r\\nThese were his words. The Lord had made him so, yet he supposed the\\r\\nLord cared as much for him as for another. “I have always been so,”\\r\\nsaid he, “from my childhood; I never had much mind; I was not like\\r\\nother children; I am weak in the head. It was the Lord’s will, I\\r\\nsuppose.” And there he was to prove the truth of his words. He was a\\r\\nmetaphysical puzzle to me. I have rarely met a fellow-man on such\\r\\npromising ground,—it was so simple and sincere and so true all that he\\r\\nsaid. And, true enough, in proportion as he appeared to humble himself\\r\\nwas he exalted. I did not know at first but it was the result of a wise\\r\\npolicy. It seemed that from such a basis of truth and frankness as the\\r\\npoor weak-headed pauper had laid, our intercourse might go forward to\\r\\nsomething better than the intercourse of sages.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had some guests from those not reckoned commonly among the town’s\\r\\npoor, but who should be; who are among the world’s poor, at any rate;\\r\\nguests who appeal, not to your hospitality, but to your\\r\\n_hospitalality_; who earnestly wish to be helped, and preface their\\r\\nappeal with the information that they are resolved, for one thing,\\r\\nnever to help themselves. I require of a visitor that he be not\\r\\nactually starving, though he may have the very best appetite in the\\r\\nworld, however he got it. Objects of charity are not guests. Men who\\r\\ndid not know when their visit had terminated, though I went about my\\r\\nbusiness again, answering them from greater and greater remoteness. Men\\r\\nof almost every degree of wit called on me in the migrating season.\\r\\nSome who had more wits than they knew what to do with; runaway slaves\\r\\nwith plantation manners, who listened from time to time, like the fox\\r\\nin the fable, as if they heard the hounds a-baying on their track, and\\r\\nlooked at me beseechingly, as much as to say,—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “O Christian, will you send me back?”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne real runaway slave, among the rest, whom I helped to forward toward\\r\\nthe northstar. Men of one idea, like a hen with one chicken, and that a\\r\\nduckling; men of a thousand ideas, and unkempt heads, like those hens\\r\\nwhich are made to take charge of a hundred chickens, all in pursuit of\\r\\none bug, a score of them lost in every morning’s dew,—and become\\r\\nfrizzled and mangy in consequence; men of ideas instead of legs, a sort\\r\\nof intellectual centipede that made you crawl all over. One man\\r\\nproposed a book in which visitors should write their names, as at the\\r\\nWhite Mountains; but, alas! I have too good a memory to make that\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not but notice some of the peculiarities of my visitors. Girls\\r\\nand boys and young women generally seemed glad to be in the woods. They\\r\\nlooked in the pond and at the flowers, and improved their time. Men of\\r\\nbusiness, even farmers, thought only of solitude and employment, and of\\r\\nthe great distance at which I dwelt from something or other; and though\\r\\nthey said that they loved a ramble in the woods occasionally, it was\\r\\nobvious that they did not. Restless committed men, whose time was all\\r\\ntaken up in getting a living or keeping it; ministers who spoke of God\\r\\nas if they enjoyed a monopoly of the subject, who could not bear all\\r\\nkinds of opinions; doctors, lawyers, uneasy housekeepers who pried into\\r\\nmy cupboard and bed when I was out,—how came Mrs. —— to know that my\\r\\nsheets were not as clean as hers?—young men who had ceased to be young,\\r\\nand had concluded that it was safest to follow the beaten track of the\\r\\nprofessions,—all these generally said that it was not possible to do so\\r\\nmuch good in my position. Ay! there was the rub. The old and infirm and\\r\\nthe timid, of whatever age or sex, thought most of sickness, and sudden\\r\\naccident and death; to them life seemed full of danger,—what danger is\\r\\nthere if you don’t think of any?—and they thought that a prudent man\\r\\nwould carefully select the safest position, where Dr. B. might be on\\r\\nhand at a moment’s warning. To them the village was literally a\\r\\n_com-munity_, a league for mutual defence, and you would suppose that\\r\\nthey would not go a-huckleberrying without a medicine chest. The amount\\r\\nof it is, if a man is alive, there is always _danger_ that he may die,\\r\\nthough the danger must be allowed to be less in proportion as he is\\r\\ndead-and-alive to begin with. A man sits as many risks as he runs.\\r\\nFinally, there were the self-styled reformers, the greatest bores of\\r\\nall, who thought that I was forever singing,—\\r\\n\\r\\n     This is the house that I built;\\r\\n     This is the man that lives in the house that I built;\\r\\n\\r\\nbut they did not know that the third line was,—\\r\\n\\r\\n     These are the folks that worry the man\\r\\n     That lives in the house that I built.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not fear the hen-harriers, for I kept no chickens; but I feared\\r\\nthe men-harriers rather.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had more cheering visitors than the last. Children come a-berrying,\\r\\nrailroad men taking a Sunday morning walk in clean shirts, fishermen\\r\\nand hunters, poets and philosophers; in short, all honest pilgrims, who\\r\\ncame out to the woods for freedom’s sake, and really left the village\\r\\nbehind, I was ready to greet with,—“Welcome, Englishmen! welcome,\\r\\nEnglishmen!” for I had had communication with that race.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bean-Field\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile my beans, the length of whose rows, added together, was seven\\r\\nmiles already planted, were impatient to be hoed, for the earliest had\\r\\ngrown considerably before the latest were in the ground; indeed they\\r\\nwere not easily to be put off. What was the meaning of this so steady\\r\\nand self-respecting, this small Herculean labor, I knew not. I came to\\r\\nlove my rows, my beans, though so many more than I wanted. They\\r\\nattached me to the earth, and so I got strength like Antæus. But why\\r\\nshould I raise them? Only Heaven knows. This was my curious labor all\\r\\nsummer,—to make this portion of the earth’s surface, which had yielded\\r\\nonly cinquefoil, blackberries, johnswort, and the like, before, sweet\\r\\nwild fruits and pleasant flowers, produce instead this pulse. What\\r\\nshall I learn of beans or beans of me? I cherish them, I hoe them,\\r\\nearly and late I have an eye to them; and this is my day’s work. It is\\r\\na fine broad leaf to look on. My auxiliaries are the dews and rains\\r\\nwhich water this dry soil, and what fertility is in the soil itself,\\r\\nwhich for the most part is lean and effete. My enemies are worms, cool\\r\\ndays, and most of all woodchucks. The last have nibbled for me a\\r\\nquarter of an acre clean. But what right had I to oust johnswort and\\r\\nthe rest, and break up their ancient herb garden? Soon, however, the\\r\\nremaining beans will be too tough for them, and go forward to meet new\\r\\nfoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was four years old, as I well remember, I was brought from\\r\\nBoston to this my native town, through these very woods and this field,\\r\\nto the pond. It is one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory. And\\r\\nnow to-night my flute has waked the echoes over that very water. The\\r\\npines still stand here older than I; or, if some have fallen, I have\\r\\ncooked my supper with their stumps, and a new growth is rising all\\r\\naround, preparing another aspect for new infant eyes. Almost the same\\r\\njohnswort springs from the same perennial root in this pasture, and\\r\\neven I have at length helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of my\\r\\ninfant dreams, and one of the results of my presence and influence is\\r\\nseen in these bean leaves, corn blades, and potato vines.\\r\\n\\r\\nI planted about two acres and a half of upland; and as it was only\\r\\nabout fifteen years since the land was cleared, and I myself had got\\r\\nout two or three cords of stumps, I did not give it any manure; but in\\r\\nthe course of the summer it appeared by the arrowheads which I turned\\r\\nup in hoeing, that an extinct nation had anciently dwelt here and\\r\\nplanted corn and beans ere white men came to clear the land, and so, to\\r\\nsome extent, had exhausted the soil for this very crop.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore yet any woodchuck or squirrel had run across the road, or the\\r\\nsun had got above the shrub oaks, while all the dew was on, though the\\r\\nfarmers warned me against it,—I would advise you to do all your work if\\r\\npossible while the dew is on,—I began to level the ranks of haughty\\r\\nweeds in my bean-field and throw dust upon their heads. Early in the\\r\\nmorning I worked barefooted, dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewy\\r\\nand crumbling sand, but later in the day the sun blistered my feet.\\r\\nThere the sun lighted me to hoe beans, pacing slowly backward and\\r\\nforward over that yellow gravelly upland, between the long green rows,\\r\\nfifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub oak copse where I\\r\\ncould rest in the shade, the other in a blackberry field where the\\r\\ngreen berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another bout.\\r\\nRemoving the weeds, putting fresh soil about the bean stems, and\\r\\nencouraging this weed which I had sown, making the yellow soil express\\r\\nits summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood\\r\\nand piper and millet grass, making the earth say beans instead of\\r\\ngrass,—this was my daily work. As I had little aid from horses or\\r\\ncattle, or hired men or boys, or improved implements of husbandry, I\\r\\nwas much slower, and became much more intimate with my beans than\\r\\nusual. But labor of the hands, even when pursued to the verge of\\r\\ndrudgery, is perhaps never the worst form of idleness. It has a\\r\\nconstant and imperishable moral, and to the scholar it yields a classic\\r\\nresult. A very _agricola laboriosus_ was I to travellers bound westward\\r\\nthrough Lincoln and Wayland to nobody knows where; they sitting at\\r\\ntheir ease in gigs, with elbows on knees, and reins loosely hanging in\\r\\nfestoons; I the home-staying, laborious native of the soil. But soon my\\r\\nhomestead was out of their sight and thought. It was the only open and\\r\\ncultivated field for a great distance on either side of the road; so\\r\\nthey made the most of it; and sometimes the man in the field heard more\\r\\nof travellers’ gossip and comment than was meant for his ear: “Beans so\\r\\nlate! peas so late!”—for I continued to plant when others had begun to\\r\\nhoe,—the ministerial husbandman had not suspected it. “Corn, my boy,\\r\\nfor fodder; corn for fodder.” “Does he _live_ there?” asks the black\\r\\nbonnet of the gray coat; and the hard-featured farmer reins up his\\r\\ngrateful dobbin to inquire what you are doing where he sees no manure\\r\\nin the furrow, and recommends a little chip dirt, or any little waste\\r\\nstuff, or it may be ashes or plaster. But here were two acres and a\\r\\nhalf of furrows, and only a hoe for cart and two hands to draw\\r\\nit,—there being an aversion to other carts and horses,—and chip dirt\\r\\nfar away. Fellow-travellers as they rattled by compared it aloud with\\r\\nthe fields which they had passed, so that I came to know how I stood in\\r\\nthe agricultural world. This was one field not in Mr. Coleman’s report.\\r\\nAnd, by the way, who estimates the value of the crop which nature\\r\\nyields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man? The crop of\\r\\n_English_ hay is carefully weighed, the moisture calculated, the\\r\\nsilicates and the potash; but in all dells and pond holes in the woods\\r\\nand pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by\\r\\nman. Mine was, as it were, the connecting link between wild and\\r\\ncultivated fields; as some states are civilized, and others\\r\\nhalf-civilized, and others savage or barbarous, so my field was, though\\r\\nnot in a bad sense, a half-cultivated field. They were beans cheerfully\\r\\nreturning to their wild and primitive state that I cultivated, and my\\r\\nhoe played the _Ranz des Vaches_ for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNear at hand, upon the topmost spray of a birch, sings the\\r\\nbrown-thrasher—or red mavis, as some love to call him—all the morning,\\r\\nglad of your society, that would find out another farmer’s field if\\r\\nyours were not here. While you are planting the seed, he cries,—“Drop\\r\\nit, drop it,—cover it up, cover it up,—pull it up, pull it up, pull it\\r\\nup.” But this was not corn, and so it was safe from such enemies as he.\\r\\nYou may wonder what his rigmarole, his amateur Paganini performances on\\r\\none string or on twenty, have to do with your planting, and yet prefer\\r\\nit to leached ashes or plaster. It was a cheap sort of top dressing in\\r\\nwhich I had entire faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I drew a still fresher soil about the rows with my hoe, I disturbed\\r\\nthe ashes of unchronicled nations who in primeval years lived under\\r\\nthese heavens, and their small implements of war and hunting were\\r\\nbrought to the light of this modern day. They lay mingled with other\\r\\nnatural stones, some of which bore the marks of having been burned by\\r\\nIndian fires, and some by the sun, and also bits of pottery and glass\\r\\nbrought hither by the recent cultivators of the soil. When my hoe\\r\\ntinkled against the stones, that music echoed to the woods and the sky,\\r\\nand was an accompaniment to my labor which yielded an instant and\\r\\nimmeasurable crop. It was no longer beans that I hoed, nor I that hoed\\r\\nbeans; and I remembered with as much pity as pride, if I remembered at\\r\\nall, my acquaintances who had gone to the city to attend the oratorios.\\r\\nThe night-hawk circled overhead in the sunny afternoons—for I sometimes\\r\\nmade a day of it—like a mote in the eye, or in heaven’s eye, falling\\r\\nfrom time to time with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent,\\r\\ntorn at last to very rags and tatters, and yet a seamless cope\\r\\nremained; small imps that fill the air and lay their eggs on the ground\\r\\non bare sand or rocks on the tops of hills, where few have found them;\\r\\ngraceful and slender like ripples caught up from the pond, as leaves\\r\\nare raised by the wind to float in the heavens; such kindredship is in\\r\\nNature. The hawk is aerial brother of the wave which he sails over and\\r\\nsurveys, those his perfect air-inflated wings answering to the\\r\\nelemental unfledged pinions of the sea. Or sometimes I watched a pair\\r\\nof hen-hawks circling high in the sky, alternately soaring and\\r\\ndescending, approaching, and leaving one another, as if they were the\\r\\nembodiment of my own thoughts. Or I was attracted by the passage of\\r\\nwild pigeons from this wood to that, with a slight quivering winnowing\\r\\nsound and carrier haste; or from under a rotten stump my hoe turned up\\r\\na sluggish portentous and outlandish spotted salamander, a trace of\\r\\nEgypt and the Nile, yet our contemporary. When I paused to lean on my\\r\\nhoe, these sounds and sights I heard and saw anywhere in the row, a\\r\\npart of the inexhaustible entertainment which the country offers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn gala days the town fires its great guns, which echo like popguns to\\r\\nthese woods, and some waifs of martial music occasionally penetrate\\r\\nthus far. To me, away there in my bean-field at the other end of the\\r\\ntown, the big guns sounded as if a puffball had burst; and when there\\r\\nwas a military turnout of which I was ignorant, I have sometimes had a\\r\\nvague sense all the day of some sort of itching and disease in the\\r\\nhorizon, as if some eruption would break out there soon, either\\r\\nscarlatina or canker-rash, until at length some more favorable puff of\\r\\nwind, making haste over the fields and up the Wayland road, brought me\\r\\ninformation of the “trainers.” It seemed by the distant hum as if\\r\\nsomebody’s bees had swarmed, and that the neighbors, according to\\r\\nVirgil’s advice, by a faint _tintinnabulum_ upon the most sonorous of\\r\\ntheir domestic utensils, were endeavoring to call them down into the\\r\\nhive again. And when the sound died quite away, and the hum had ceased,\\r\\nand the most favorable breezes told no tale, I knew that they had got\\r\\nthe last drone of them all safely into the Middlesex hive, and that now\\r\\ntheir minds were bent on the honey with which it was smeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt proud to know that the liberties of Massachusetts and of our\\r\\nfatherland were in such safe keeping; and as I turned to my hoeing\\r\\nagain I was filled with an inexpressible confidence, and pursued my\\r\\nlabor cheerfully with a calm trust in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen there were several bands of musicians, it sounded as if all the\\r\\nvillage was a vast bellows, and all the buildings expanded and\\r\\ncollapsed alternately with a din. But sometimes it was a really noble\\r\\nand inspiring strain that reached these woods, and the trumpet that\\r\\nsings of fame, and I felt as if I could spit a Mexican with a good\\r\\nrelish,—for why should we always stand for trifles?—and looked round\\r\\nfor a woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my chivalry upon. These martial\\r\\nstrains seemed as far away as Palestine, and reminded me of a march of\\r\\ncrusaders in the horizon, with a slight tantivy and tremulous motion of\\r\\nthe elm-tree tops which overhang the village. This was one of the\\r\\n_great_ days; though the sky had from my clearing only the same\\r\\neverlastingly great look that it wears daily, and I saw no difference\\r\\nin it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a singular experience that long acquaintance which I cultivated\\r\\nwith beans, what with planting, and hoeing, and harvesting, and\\r\\nthreshing, and picking over and selling them,—the last was the hardest\\r\\nof all,—I might add eating, for I did taste. I was determined to know\\r\\nbeans. When they were growing, I used to hoe from five o’clock in the\\r\\nmorning till noon, and commonly spent the rest of the day about other\\r\\naffairs. Consider the intimate and curious acquaintance one makes with\\r\\nvarious kinds of weeds,—it will bear some iteration in the account, for\\r\\nthere was no little iteration in the labor,—disturbing their delicate\\r\\norganizations so ruthlessly, and making such invidious distinctions\\r\\nwith his hoe, levelling whole ranks of one species, and sedulously\\r\\ncultivating another. That’s Roman wormwood,—that’s pigweed,—that’s\\r\\nsorrel,—that’s piper-grass,—have at him, chop him up, turn his roots\\r\\nupward to the sun, don’t let him have a fibre in the shade, if you do\\r\\nhe’ll turn himself t’other side up and be as green as a leek in two\\r\\ndays. A long war, not with cranes, but with weeds, those Trojans who\\r\\nhad sun and rain and dews on their side. Daily the beans saw me come to\\r\\ntheir rescue armed with a hoe, and thin the ranks of their enemies,\\r\\nfilling up the trenches with weedy dead. Many a lusty crest-waving\\r\\nHector, that towered a whole foot above his crowding comrades, fell\\r\\nbefore my weapon and rolled in the dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose summer days which some of my contemporaries devoted to the fine\\r\\narts in Boston or Rome, and others to contemplation in India, and\\r\\nothers to trade in London or New York, I thus, with the other farmers\\r\\nof New England, devoted to husbandry. Not that I wanted beans to eat,\\r\\nfor I am by nature a Pythagorean, so far as beans are concerned,\\r\\nwhether they mean porridge or voting, and exchanged them for rice; but,\\r\\nperchance, as some must work in fields if only for the sake of tropes\\r\\nand expression, to serve a parable-maker one day. It was on the whole a\\r\\nrare amusement, which, continued too long, might have become a\\r\\ndissipation. Though I gave them no manure, and did not hoe them all\\r\\nonce, I hoed them unusually well as far as I went, and was paid for it\\r\\nin the end, “there being in truth,” as Evelyn says, “no compost or\\r\\nlætation whatsoever comparable to this continual motion, repastination,\\r\\nand turning of the mould with the spade.” “The earth,” he adds\\r\\nelsewhere, “especially if fresh, has a certain magnetism in it, by\\r\\nwhich it attracts the salt, power, or virtue (call it either) which\\r\\ngives it life, and is the logic of all the labor and stir we keep about\\r\\nit, to sustain us; all dungings and other sordid temperings being but\\r\\nthe vicars succedaneous to this improvement.” Moreover, this being one\\r\\nof those “worn-out and exhausted lay fields which enjoy their sabbath,”\\r\\nhad perchance, as Sir Kenelm Digby thinks likely, attracted “vital\\r\\nspirits” from the air. I harvested twelve bushels of beans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to be more particular, for it is complained that Mr. Coleman has\\r\\nreported chiefly the expensive experiments of gentlemen farmers, my\\r\\noutgoes were,—\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    For a hoe,.................................. $ 0.54\\r\\n    Ploughing, harrowing, and furrowing,.........  7.50  Too much.\\r\\n    Beans for seed,..............................  3.12½\\r\\n    Potatoes for seed,...........................  1.33\\r\\n    Peas for seed,...............................  0.40\\r\\n    Turnip seed,.................................  0.06\\r\\n    White line for crow fence,...................  0.02\\r\\n    Horse cultivator and boy three hours,........  1.00\\r\\n    Horse and cart to get crop,..................  0.75\\r\\n                                                ————\\r\\n        In all,................................. $14.72½\\r\\n\\r\\nMy income was (patrem familias vendacem, non emacem esse oportet),\\r\\nfrom\\r\\n\\r\\n    Nine bushels and twelve quarts of beans sold,. $16.94\\r\\n    Five    \"    large potatoes,.................... 2.50\\r\\n    Nine    \"    small,............................. 2.25\\r\\n    Grass,.......................................... 1.00\\r\\n    Stalks,......................................... 0.75\\r\\n                                                  ————\\r\\n        In all,................................... $23.44\\r\\n    Leaving a pecuniary profit,\\r\\n        as I have elsewhere said, of..............  $8.71½.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the result of my experience in raising beans. Plant the common\\r\\nsmall white bush bean about the first of June, in rows three feet by\\r\\neighteen inches apart, being careful to select fresh round and unmixed\\r\\nseed. First look out for worms, and supply vacancies by planting anew.\\r\\nThen look out for woodchucks, if it is an exposed place, for they will\\r\\nnibble off the earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go; and\\r\\nagain, when the young tendrils make their appearance, they have notice\\r\\nof it, and will shear them off with both buds and young pods, sitting\\r\\nerect like a squirrel. But above all harvest as early as possible, if\\r\\nyou would escape frosts and have a fair and salable crop; you may save\\r\\nmuch loss by this means.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis further experience also I gained. I said to myself, I will not\\r\\nplant beans and corn with so much industry another summer, but such\\r\\nseeds, if the seed is not lost, as sincerity, truth, simplicity, faith,\\r\\ninnocence, and the like, and see if they will not grow in this soil,\\r\\neven with less toil and manurance, and sustain me, for surely it has\\r\\nnot been exhausted for these crops. Alas! I said this to myself; but\\r\\nnow another summer is gone, and another, and another, and I am obliged\\r\\nto say to you, Reader, that the seeds which I planted, if indeed they\\r\\n_were_ the seeds of those virtues, were wormeaten or had lost their\\r\\nvitality, and so did not come up. Commonly men will only be brave as\\r\\ntheir fathers were brave, or timid. This generation is very sure to\\r\\nplant corn and beans each new year precisely as the Indians did\\r\\ncenturies ago and taught the first settlers to do, as if there were a\\r\\nfate in it. I saw an old man the other day, to my astonishment, making\\r\\nthe holes with a hoe for the seventieth time at least, and not for\\r\\nhimself to lie down in! But why should not the New Englander try new\\r\\nadventures, and not lay so much stress on his grain, his potato and\\r\\ngrass crop, and his orchards,—raise other crops than these? Why concern\\r\\nourselves so much about our beans for seed, and not be concerned at all\\r\\nabout a new generation of men? We should really be fed and cheered if\\r\\nwhen we met a man we were sure to see that some of the qualities which\\r\\nI have named, which we all prize more than those other productions, but\\r\\nwhich are for the most part broadcast and floating in the air, had\\r\\ntaken root and grown in him. Here comes such a subtile and ineffable\\r\\nquality, for instance, as truth or justice, though the slightest amount\\r\\nor new variety of it, along the road. Our ambassadors should be\\r\\ninstructed to send home such seeds as these, and Congress help to\\r\\ndistribute them over all the land. We should never stand upon ceremony\\r\\nwith sincerity. We should never cheat and insult and banish one another\\r\\nby our meanness, if there were present the kernel of worth and\\r\\nfriendliness. We should not meet thus in haste. Most men I do not meet\\r\\nat all, for they seem not to have time; they are busy about their\\r\\nbeans. We would not deal with a man thus plodding ever, leaning on a\\r\\nhoe or a spade as a staff between his work, not as a mushroom, but\\r\\npartially risen out of the earth, something more than erect, like\\r\\nswallows alighted and walking on the ground:—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “And as he spake, his wings would now and then\\r\\n     Spread, as he meant to fly, then close again,”\\r\\n\\r\\nso that we should suspect that we might be conversing with an angel.\\r\\nBread may not always nourish us; but it always does us good, it even\\r\\ntakes stiffness out of our joints, and makes us supple and buoyant,\\r\\nwhen we knew not what ailed us, to recognize any generosity in man or\\r\\nNature, to share any unmixed and heroic joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAncient poetry and mythology suggest, at least, that husbandry was once\\r\\na sacred art; but it is pursued with irreverent haste and heedlessness\\r\\nby us, our object being to have large farms and large crops merely. We\\r\\nhave no festival, nor procession, nor ceremony, not excepting our\\r\\nCattle-shows and so called Thanksgivings, by which the farmer expresses\\r\\na sense of the sacredness of his calling, or is reminded of its sacred\\r\\norigin. It is the premium and the feast which tempt him. He sacrifices\\r\\nnot to Ceres and the Terrestrial Jove, but to the infernal Plutus\\r\\nrather. By avarice and selfishness, and a grovelling habit, from which\\r\\nnone of us is free, of regarding the soil as property, or the means of\\r\\nacquiring property chiefly, the landscape is deformed, husbandry is\\r\\ndegraded with us, and the farmer leads the meanest of lives. He knows\\r\\nNature but as a robber. Cato says that the profits of agriculture are\\r\\nparticularly pious or just, (_maximeque pius quæstus_), and according\\r\\nto Varro the old Romans “called the same earth Mother and Ceres, and\\r\\nthought that they who cultivated it led a pious and useful life, and\\r\\nthat they alone were left of the race of King Saturn.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and\\r\\non the prairies and forests without distinction. They all reflect and\\r\\nabsorb his rays alike, and the former make but a small part of the\\r\\nglorious picture which he beholds in his daily course. In his view the\\r\\nearth is all equally cultivated like a garden. Therefore we should\\r\\nreceive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust\\r\\nand magnanimity. What though I value the seed of these beans, and\\r\\nharvest that in the fall of the year? This broad field which I have\\r\\nlooked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator, but away\\r\\nfrom me to influences more genial to it, which water and make it green.\\r\\nThese beans have results which are not harvested by me. Do they not\\r\\ngrow for woodchucks partly? The ear of wheat (in Latin _spica_,\\r\\nobsoletely _speca_, from _spe_, hope) should not be the only hope of\\r\\nthe husbandman; its kernel or grain (_granum_ from _gerendo_, bearing)\\r\\nis not all that it bears. How, then, can our harvest fail? Shall I not\\r\\nrejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary\\r\\nof the birds? It matters little comparatively whether the fields fill\\r\\nthe farmer’s barns. The true husbandman will cease from anxiety, as the\\r\\nsquirrels manifest no concern whether the woods will bear chestnuts\\r\\nthis year or not, and finish his labor with every day, relinquishing\\r\\nall claim to the produce of his fields, and sacrificing in his mind not\\r\\nonly his first but his last fruits also.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Village\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter hoeing, or perhaps reading and writing, in the forenoon, I\\r\\nusually bathed again in the pond, swimming across one of its coves for\\r\\na stint, and washed the dust of labor from my person, or smoothed out\\r\\nthe last wrinkle which study had made, and for the afternoon was\\r\\nabsolutely free. Every day or two I strolled to the village to hear\\r\\nsome of the gossip which is incessantly going on there, circulating\\r\\neither from mouth to mouth, or from newspaper to newspaper, and which,\\r\\ntaken in homœopathic doses, was really as refreshing in its way as the\\r\\nrustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs. As I walked in the woods to\\r\\nsee the birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see the men\\r\\nand boys; instead of the wind among the pines I heard the carts rattle.\\r\\nIn one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the\\r\\nriver meadows; under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other\\r\\nhorizon was a village of busy men, as curious to me as if they had been\\r\\nprairie dogs, each sitting at the mouth of its burrow, or running over\\r\\nto a neighbor’s to gossip. I went there frequently to observe their\\r\\nhabits. The village appeared to me a great news room; and on one side,\\r\\nto support it, as once at Redding & Company’s on State Street, they\\r\\nkept nuts and raisins, or salt and meal and other groceries. Some have\\r\\nsuch a vast appetite for the former commodity, that is, the news, and\\r\\nsuch sound digestive organs, that they can sit forever in public\\r\\navenues without stirring, and let it simmer and whisper through them\\r\\nlike the Etesian winds, or as if inhaling ether, it only producing\\r\\nnumbness and insensibility to pain,—otherwise it would often be painful\\r\\nto hear,—without affecting the consciousness. I hardly ever failed,\\r\\nwhen I rambled through the village, to see a row of such worthies,\\r\\neither sitting on a ladder sunning themselves, with their bodies\\r\\ninclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and\\r\\nthat, from time to time, with a voluptuous expression, or else leaning\\r\\nagainst a barn with their hands in their pockets, like caryatides, as\\r\\nif to prop it up. They, being commonly out of doors, heard whatever was\\r\\nin the wind. These are the coarsest mills, in which all gossip is first\\r\\nrudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more\\r\\ndelicate hoppers within doors. I observed that the vitals of the\\r\\nvillage were the grocery, the bar-room, the post-office, and the bank;\\r\\nand, as a necessary part of the machinery, they kept a bell, a big gun,\\r\\nand a fire-engine, at convenient places; and the houses were so\\r\\narranged as to make the most of mankind, in lanes and fronting one\\r\\nanother, so that every traveller had to run the gantlet, and every man,\\r\\nwoman, and child might get a lick at him. Of course, those who were\\r\\nstationed nearest to the head of the line, where they could most see\\r\\nand be seen, and have the first blow at him, paid the highest prices\\r\\nfor their places; and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts,\\r\\nwhere long gaps in the line began to occur, and the traveller could get\\r\\nover walls or turn aside into cow paths, and so escape, paid a very\\r\\nslight ground or window tax. Signs were hung out on all sides to allure\\r\\nhim; some to catch him by the appetite, as the tavern and victualling\\r\\ncellar; some by the fancy, as the dry goods store and the jeweller’s;\\r\\nand others by the hair or the feet or the skirts, as the barber, the\\r\\nshoemaker, or the tailor. Besides, there was a still more terrible\\r\\nstanding invitation to call at every one of these houses, and company\\r\\nexpected about these times. For the most part I escaped wonderfully\\r\\nfrom these dangers, either by proceeding at once boldly and without\\r\\ndeliberation to the goal, as is recommended to those who run the\\r\\ngantlet, or by keeping my thoughts on high things, like Orpheus, who,\\r\\n“loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre, drowned the voices\\r\\nof the Sirens, and kept out of danger.” Sometimes I bolted suddenly,\\r\\nand nobody could tell my whereabouts, for I did not stand much about\\r\\ngracefulness, and never hesitated at a gap in a fence. I was even\\r\\naccustomed to make an irruption into some houses, where I was well\\r\\nentertained, and after learning the kernels and very last sieve-ful of\\r\\nnews, what had subsided, the prospects of war and peace, and whether\\r\\nthe world was likely to hold together much longer, I was let out\\r\\nthrough the rear avenues, and so escaped to the woods again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into\\r\\nthe night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from\\r\\nsome bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian\\r\\nmeal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all\\r\\ntight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of\\r\\nthoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the\\r\\nhelm when it was plain sailing. I had many a genial thought by the\\r\\ncabin fire “as I sailed.” I was never cast away nor distressed in any\\r\\nweather, though I encountered some severe storms. It is darker in the\\r\\nwoods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I frequently had to\\r\\nlook up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to\\r\\nlearn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet\\r\\nthe faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of\\r\\nparticular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines\\r\\nfor instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the\\r\\nwoods, invariably, in the darkest night. Sometimes, after coming home\\r\\nthus late in a dark and muggy night, when my feet felt the path which\\r\\nmy eyes could not see, dreaming and absent-minded all the way, until I\\r\\nwas aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch, I have not\\r\\nbeen able to recall a single step of my walk, and I have thought that\\r\\nperhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsake\\r\\nit, as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance. Several\\r\\ntimes, when a visitor chanced to stay into evening, and it proved a\\r\\ndark night, I was obliged to conduct him to the cart-path in the rear\\r\\nof the house, and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue,\\r\\nand in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his\\r\\neyes. One very dark night I directed thus on their way two young men\\r\\nwho had been fishing in the pond. They lived about a mile off through\\r\\nthe woods, and were quite used to the route. A day or two after one of\\r\\nthem told me that they wandered about the greater part of the night,\\r\\nclose by their own premises, and did not get home till toward morning,\\r\\nby which time, as there had been several heavy showers in the mean\\r\\nwhile, and the leaves were very wet, they were drenched to their skins.\\r\\nI have heard of many going astray even in the village streets, when the\\r\\ndarkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife, as the saying\\r\\nis. Some who live in the outskirts, having come to town a-shopping in\\r\\ntheir wagons, have been obliged to put up for the night; and gentlemen\\r\\nand ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way,\\r\\nfeeling the sidewalk only with their feet, and not knowing when they\\r\\nturned. It is a surprising and memorable, as well as valuable\\r\\nexperience, to be lost in the woods any time. Often in a snow storm,\\r\\neven by day, one will come out upon a well-known road and yet find it\\r\\nimpossible to tell which way leads to the village. Though he knows that\\r\\nhe has travelled it a thousand times, he cannot recognize a feature in\\r\\nit, but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in Siberia. By\\r\\nnight, of course, the perplexity is infinitely greater. In our most\\r\\ntrivial walks, we are constantly, though unconsciously, steering like\\r\\npilots by certain well-known beacons and headlands, and if we go beyond\\r\\nour usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some\\r\\nneighboring cape; and not till we are completely lost, or turned\\r\\nround,—for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut\\r\\nin this world to be lost,—do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness\\r\\nof Nature. Every man has to learn the points of compass again as often\\r\\nas he awakes, whether from sleep or any abstraction. Not till we are\\r\\nlost, in other words not till we have lost the world, do we begin to\\r\\nfind ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our\\r\\nrelations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne afternoon, near the end of the first summer, when I went to the\\r\\nvillage to get a shoe from the cobbler’s, I was seized and put into\\r\\njail, because, as I have elsewhere related, I did not pay a tax to, or\\r\\nrecognize the authority of, the state which buys and sells men, women,\\r\\nand children, like cattle at the door of its senate-house. I had gone\\r\\ndown to the woods for other purposes. But, wherever a man goes, men\\r\\nwill pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions, and, if they\\r\\ncan, constrain him to belong to their desperate odd-fellow society. It\\r\\nis true, I might have resisted forcibly with more or less effect, might\\r\\nhave run “amok” against society; but I preferred that society should\\r\\nrun “amok” against me, it being the desperate party. However, I was\\r\\nreleased the next day, obtained my mended shoe, and returned to the\\r\\nwoods in season to get my dinner of huckleberries on Fair-Haven Hill. I\\r\\nwas never molested by any person but those who represented the state. I\\r\\nhad no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held my papers, not even a\\r\\nnail to put over my latch or windows. I never fastened my door night or\\r\\nday, though I was to be absent several days; not even when the next\\r\\nfall I spent a fortnight in the woods of Maine. And yet my house was\\r\\nmore respected than if it had been surrounded by a file of soldiers.\\r\\nThe tired rambler could rest and warm himself by my fire, the literary\\r\\namuse himself with the few books on my table, or the curious, by\\r\\nopening my closet door, see what was left of my dinner, and what\\r\\nprospect I had of a supper. Yet, though many people of every class came\\r\\nthis way to the pond, I suffered no serious inconvenience from these\\r\\nsources, and I never missed anything but one small book, a volume of\\r\\nHomer, which perhaps was improperly gilded, and this I trust a soldier\\r\\nof our camp has found by this time. I am convinced, that if all men\\r\\nwere to live as simply as I then did, thieving and robbery would be\\r\\nunknown. These take place only in communities where some have got more\\r\\nthan is sufficient while others have not enough. The Pope’s Homers\\r\\nwould soon get properly distributed.—\\r\\n\\r\\n                     “Nec bella fuerunt,\\r\\n     Faginus astabat dum scyphus ante dapes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n                     “Nor wars did men molest,\\r\\n     When only beechen bowls were in request.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You who govern public affairs, what need have you to employ\\r\\npunishments? Love virtue, and the people will be virtuous. The virtues\\r\\nof a superior man are like the wind; the virtues of a common man are\\r\\nlike the grass; the grass, when the wind passes over it, bends.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ponds\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, having had a surfeit of human society and gossip, and worn\\r\\nout all my village friends, I rambled still farther westward than I\\r\\nhabitually dwell, into yet more unfrequented parts of the town, “to\\r\\nfresh woods and pastures new,” or, while the sun was setting, made my\\r\\nsupper of huckleberries and blueberries on Fair Haven Hill, and laid up\\r\\na store for several days. The fruits do not yield their true flavor to\\r\\nthe purchaser of them, nor to him who raises them for the market. There\\r\\nis but one way to obtain it, yet few take that way. If you would know\\r\\nthe flavor of huckleberries, ask the cow-boy or the partridge. It is a\\r\\nvulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who never\\r\\nplucked them. A huckleberry never reaches Boston; they have not been\\r\\nknown there since they grew on her three hills. The ambrosial and\\r\\nessential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is rubbed off\\r\\nin the market cart, and they become mere provender. As long as Eternal\\r\\nJustice reigns, not one innocent huckleberry can be transported thither\\r\\nfrom the country’s hills.\\r\\n\\r\\nOccasionally, after my hoeing was done for the day, I joined some\\r\\nimpatient companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning, as\\r\\nsilent and motionless as a duck or a floating leaf, and, after\\r\\npractising various kinds of philosophy, had concluded commonly, by the\\r\\ntime I arrived, that he belonged to the ancient sect of Cœnobites.\\r\\nThere was one older man, an excellent fisher and skilled in all kinds\\r\\nof woodcraft, who was pleased to look upon my house as a building\\r\\nerected for the convenience of fishermen; and I was equally pleased\\r\\nwhen he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines. Once in a while we sat\\r\\ntogether on the pond, he at one end of the boat, and I at the other;\\r\\nbut not many words passed between us, for he had grown deaf in his\\r\\nlater years, but he occasionally hummed a psalm, which harmonized well\\r\\nenough with my philosophy. Our intercourse was thus altogether one of\\r\\nunbroken harmony, far more pleasing to remember than if it had been\\r\\ncarried on by speech. When, as was commonly the case, I had none to\\r\\ncommune with, I used to raise the echoes by striking with a paddle on\\r\\nthe side of my boat, filling the surrounding woods with circling and\\r\\ndilating sound, stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild\\r\\nbeasts, until I elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hill-side.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn warm evenings I frequently sat in the boat playing the flute, and\\r\\nsaw the perch, which I seemed to have charmed, hovering around me, and\\r\\nthe moon travelling over the ribbed bottom, which was strewed with the\\r\\nwrecks of the forest. Formerly I had come to this pond adventurously,\\r\\nfrom time to time, in dark summer nights, with a companion, and making\\r\\na fire close to the water’s edge, which we thought attracted the\\r\\nfishes, we caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread; and\\r\\nwhen we had done, far in the night, threw the burning brands high into\\r\\nthe air like skyrockets, which, coming down into the pond, were\\r\\nquenched with a loud hissing, and we were suddenly groping in total\\r\\ndarkness. Through this, whistling a tune, we took our way to the haunts\\r\\nof men again. But now I had made my home by the shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, after staying in a village parlor till the family had all\\r\\nretired, I have returned to the woods, and, partly with a view to the\\r\\nnext day’s dinner, spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by\\r\\nmoonlight, serenaded by owls and foxes, and hearing, from time to time,\\r\\nthe creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand. These experiences\\r\\nwere very memorable and valuable to me,—anchored in forty feet of\\r\\nwater, and twenty or thirty rods from the shore, surrounded sometimes\\r\\nby thousands of small perch and shiners, dimpling the surface with\\r\\ntheir tails in the moonlight, and communicating by a long flaxen line\\r\\nwith mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feet\\r\\nbelow, or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as I\\r\\ndrifted in the gentle night breeze, now and then feeling a slight\\r\\nvibration along it, indicative of some life prowling about its\\r\\nextremity, of dull uncertain blundering purpose there, and slow to make\\r\\nup its mind. At length you slowly raise, pulling hand over hand, some\\r\\nhorned pout squeaking and squirming to the upper air. It was very\\r\\nqueer, especially in dark nights, when your thoughts had wandered to\\r\\nvast and cosmogonal themes in other spheres, to feel this faint jerk,\\r\\nwhich came to interrupt your dreams and link you to Nature again. It\\r\\nseemed as if I might next cast my line upward into the air, as well as\\r\\ndownward into this element, which was scarcely more dense. Thus I\\r\\ncaught two fishes as it were with one hook.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scenery of Walden is on a humble scale, and, though very beautiful,\\r\\ndoes not approach to grandeur, nor can it much concern one who has not\\r\\nlong frequented it or lived by its shore; yet this pond is so\\r\\nremarkable for its depth and purity as to merit a particular\\r\\ndescription. It is a clear and deep green well, half a mile long and a\\r\\nmile and three quarters in circumference, and contains about sixty-one\\r\\nand a half acres; a perennial spring in the midst of pine and oak\\r\\nwoods, without any visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds and\\r\\nevaporation. The surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to the\\r\\nheight of forty to eighty feet, though on the south-east and east they\\r\\nattain to about one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet\\r\\nrespectively, within a quarter and a third of a mile. They are\\r\\nexclusively woodland. All our Concord waters have two colors at least;\\r\\none when viewed at a distance, and another, more proper, close at hand.\\r\\nThe first depends more on the light, and follows the sky. In clear\\r\\nweather, in summer, they appear blue at a little distance, especially\\r\\nif agitated, and at a great distance all appear alike. In stormy\\r\\nweather they are sometimes of a dark slate color. The sea, however, is\\r\\nsaid to be blue one day and green another without any perceptible\\r\\nchange in the atmosphere. I have seen our river, when, the landscape\\r\\nbeing covered with snow, both water and ice were almost as green as\\r\\ngrass. Some consider blue “to be the color of pure water, whether\\r\\nliquid or solid.” But, looking directly down into our waters from a\\r\\nboat, they are seen to be of very different colors. Walden is blue at\\r\\none time and green at another, even from the same point of view. Lying\\r\\nbetween the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both.\\r\\nViewed from a hill-top it reflects the color of the sky; but near at\\r\\nhand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the\\r\\nsand, then a light green, which gradually deepens to a uniform dark\\r\\ngreen in the body of the pond. In some lights, viewed even from a\\r\\nhill-top, it is of a vivid green next the shore. Some have referred\\r\\nthis to the reflection of the verdure; but it is equally green there\\r\\nagainst the railroad sand-bank, and in the spring, before the leaves\\r\\nare expanded, and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue\\r\\nmixed with the yellow of the sand. Such is the color of its iris. This\\r\\nis that portion, also, where in the spring, the ice being warmed by the\\r\\nheat of the sun reflected from the bottom, and also transmitted through\\r\\nthe earth, melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen\\r\\nmiddle. Like the rest of our waters, when much agitated, in clear\\r\\nweather, so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the\\r\\nright angle, or because there is more light mixed with it, it appears\\r\\nat a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself; and at such\\r\\na time, being on its surface, and looking with divided vision, so as to\\r\\nsee the reflection, I have discerned a matchless and indescribable\\r\\nlight blue, such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades\\r\\nsuggest, more cerulean than the sky itself, alternating with the\\r\\noriginal dark green on the opposite sides of the waves, which last\\r\\nappeared but muddy in comparison. It is a vitreous greenish blue, as I\\r\\nremember it, like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloud\\r\\nvistas in the west before sundown. Yet a single glass of its water held\\r\\nup to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air. It is well\\r\\nknown that a large plate of glass will have a green tint, owing, as the\\r\\nmakers say, to its “body,” but a small piece of the same will be\\r\\ncolorless. How large a body of Walden water would be required to\\r\\nreflect a green tint I have never proved. The water of our river is\\r\\nblack or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it, and,\\r\\nlike that of most ponds, imparts to the body of one bathing in it a\\r\\nyellowish tinge; but this water is of such crystalline purity that the\\r\\nbody of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness, still more\\r\\nunnatural, which, as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal,\\r\\nproduces a monstrous effect, making fit studies for a Michael Angelo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at\\r\\nthe depth of twenty-five or thirty feet. Paddling over it, you may see,\\r\\nmany feet beneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners, perhaps\\r\\nonly an inch long, yet the former easily distinguished by their\\r\\ntransverse bars, and you think that they must be ascetic fish that find\\r\\na subsistence there. Once, in the winter, many years ago, when I had\\r\\nbeen cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel, as I\\r\\nstepped ashore I tossed my axe back on to the ice, but, as if some evil\\r\\ngenius had directed it, it slid four or five rods directly into one of\\r\\nthe holes, where the water was twenty-five feet deep. Out of curiosity,\\r\\nI lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until I saw the axe\\r\\na little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and\\r\\ngently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it\\r\\nmight have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the\\r\\nhandle rotted off, if I had not disturbed it. Making another hole\\r\\ndirectly over it with an ice chisel which I had, and cutting down the\\r\\nlongest birch which I could find in the neighborhood with my knife, I\\r\\nmade a slip-noose, which I attached to its end, and, letting it down\\r\\ncarefully, passed it over the knob of the handle, and drew it by a line\\r\\nalong the birch, and so pulled the axe out again.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like\\r\\npaving stones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep\\r\\nthat in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your\\r\\nhead; and were it not for its remarkable transparency, that would be\\r\\nthe last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side.\\r\\nSome think it is bottomless. It is nowhere muddy, and a casual observer\\r\\nwould say that there were no weeds at all in it; and of noticeable\\r\\nplants, except in the little meadows recently overflowed, which do not\\r\\nproperly belong to it, a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a\\r\\nbulrush, nor even a lily, yellow or white, but only a few small\\r\\nheart-leaves and potamogetons, and perhaps a water-target or two; all\\r\\nwhich however a bather might not perceive; and these plants are clean\\r\\nand bright like the element they grow in. The stones extend a rod or\\r\\ntwo into the water, and then the bottom is pure sand, except in the\\r\\ndeepest parts, where there is usually a little sediment, probably from\\r\\nthe decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many\\r\\nsuccessive falls, and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even\\r\\nin midwinter.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have one other pond just like this, White Pond, in Nine Acre Corner,\\r\\nabout two and a half miles westerly; but, though I am acquainted with\\r\\nmost of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre I do not know a\\r\\nthird of this pure and well-like character. Successive nations\\r\\nperchance have drank at, admired, and fathomed it, and passed away, and\\r\\nstill its water is green and pellucid as ever. Not an intermitting\\r\\nspring! Perhaps on that spring morning when Adam and Eve were driven\\r\\nout of Eden Walden Pond was already in existence, and even then\\r\\nbreaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a\\r\\nsoutherly wind, and covered with myriads of ducks and geese, which had\\r\\nnot heard of the fall, when still such pure lakes sufficed them. Even\\r\\nthen it had commenced to rise and fall, and had clarified its waters\\r\\nand colored them of the hue they now wear, and obtained a patent of\\r\\nheaven to be the only Walden Pond in the world and distiller of\\r\\ncelestial dews. Who knows in how many unremembered nations’ literatures\\r\\nthis has been the Castalian Fountain? or what nymphs presided over it\\r\\nin the Golden Age? It is a gem of the first water which Concord wears\\r\\nin her coronet.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of\\r\\ntheir footsteps. I have been surprised to detect encircling the pond,\\r\\neven where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore, a narrow\\r\\nshelf-like path in the steep hill-side, alternately rising and falling,\\r\\napproaching and receding from the water’s edge, as old probably as the\\r\\nrace of man here, worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters, and still\\r\\nfrom time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the\\r\\nland. This is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of\\r\\nthe pond in winter, just after a light snow has fallen, appearing as a\\r\\nclear undulating white line, unobscured by weeds and twigs, and very\\r\\nobvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is\\r\\nhardly distinguishable close at hand. The snow reprints it, as it were,\\r\\nin clear white type alto-relievo. The ornamented grounds of villas\\r\\nwhich will one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pond rises and falls, but whether regularly or not, and within what\\r\\nperiod, nobody knows, though, as usual, many pretend to know. It is\\r\\ncommonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer, though not\\r\\ncorresponding to the general wet and dryness. I can remember when it\\r\\nwas a foot or two lower, and also when it was at least five feet\\r\\nhigher, than when I lived by it. There is a narrow sand-bar running\\r\\ninto it, with very deep water on one side, on which I helped boil a\\r\\nkettle of chowder, some six rods from the main shore, about the year\\r\\n1824, which it has not been possible to do for twenty-five years; and\\r\\non the other hand, my friends used to listen with incredulity when I\\r\\ntold them, that a few years later I was accustomed to fish from a boat\\r\\nin a secluded cove in the woods, fifteen rods from the only shore they\\r\\nknew, which place was long since converted into a meadow. But the pond\\r\\nhas risen steadily for two years, and now, in the summer of ’52, is\\r\\njust five feet higher than when I lived there, or as high as it was\\r\\nthirty years ago, and fishing goes on again in the meadow. This makes a\\r\\ndifference of level, at the outside, of six or seven feet; and yet the\\r\\nwater shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount, and\\r\\nthis overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs.\\r\\nThis same summer the pond has begun to fall again. It is remarkable\\r\\nthat this fluctuation, whether periodical or not, appears thus to\\r\\nrequire many years for its accomplishment. I have observed one rise and\\r\\na part of two falls, and I expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence\\r\\nthe water will again be as low as I have ever known it. Flint’s Pond, a\\r\\nmile eastward, allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets\\r\\nand outlets, and the smaller intermediate ponds also, sympathize with\\r\\nWalden, and recently attained their greatest height at the same time\\r\\nwith the latter. The same is true, as far as my observation goes, of\\r\\nWhite Pond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis rise and fall of Walden at long intervals serves this use at\\r\\nleast; the water standing at this great height for a year or more,\\r\\nthough it makes it difficult to walk round it, kills the shrubs and\\r\\ntrees which have sprung up about its edge since the last rise,\\r\\npitch-pines, birches, alders, aspens, and others, and, falling again,\\r\\nleaves an unobstructed shore; for, unlike many ponds and all waters\\r\\nwhich are subject to a daily tide, its shore is cleanest when the water\\r\\nis lowest. On the side of the pond next my house, a row of pitch pines\\r\\nfifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever, and\\r\\nthus a stop put to their encroachments; and their size indicates how\\r\\nmany years have elapsed since the last rise to this height. By this\\r\\nfluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore, and thus the _shore_\\r\\nis _shorn_, and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession. These\\r\\nare the lips of the lake on which no beard grows. It licks its chaps\\r\\nfrom time to time. When the water is at its height, the alders,\\r\\nwillows, and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet\\r\\nlong from all sides of their stems in the water, and to the height of\\r\\nthree or four feet from the ground, in the effort to maintain\\r\\nthemselves; and I have known the high-blueberry bushes about the shore,\\r\\nwhich commonly produce no fruit, bear an abundant crop under these\\r\\ncircumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved.\\r\\nMy townsmen have all heard the tradition, the oldest people tell me\\r\\nthat they heard it in their youth, that anciently the Indians were\\r\\nholding a pow-wow upon a hill here, which rose as high into the heavens\\r\\nas the pond now sinks deep into the earth, and they used much\\r\\nprofanity, as the story goes, though this vice is one of which the\\r\\nIndians were never guilty, and while they were thus engaged the hill\\r\\nshook and suddenly sank, and only one old squaw, named Walden, escaped,\\r\\nand from her the pond was named. It has been conjectured that when the\\r\\nhill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present\\r\\nshore. It is very certain, at any rate, that once there was no pond\\r\\nhere, and now there is one; and this Indian fable does not in any\\r\\nrespect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom I have\\r\\nmentioned, who remembers so well when he first came here with his\\r\\ndivining rod, saw a thin vapor rising from the sward, and the hazel\\r\\npointed steadily downward, and he concluded to dig a well here. As for\\r\\nthe stones, many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for\\r\\nby the action of the waves on these hills; but I observe that the\\r\\nsurrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones, so\\r\\nthat they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides of\\r\\nthe railroad cut nearest the pond; and, moreover, there are most stones\\r\\nwhere the shore is most abrupt; so that, unfortunately, it is no longer\\r\\na mystery to me. I detect the paver. If the name was not derived from\\r\\nthat of some English locality,—Saffron Walden, for instance,—one might\\r\\nsuppose that it was called originally _Walled-in_ Pond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pond was my well ready dug. For four months in the year its water\\r\\nis as cold as it is pure at all times; and I think that it is then as\\r\\ngood as any, if not the best, in the town. In the winter, all water\\r\\nwhich is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which are\\r\\nprotected from it. The temperature of the pond water which had stood in\\r\\nthe room where I sat from five o’clock in the afternoon till noon the\\r\\nnext day, the sixth of March, 1846, the thermometer having been up to\\r\\n65° or 70° some of the time, owing partly to the sun on the roof, was\\r\\n42°, or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in\\r\\nthe village just drawn. The temperature of the Boiling Spring the same\\r\\nday was 45°, or the warmest of any water tried, though it is the\\r\\ncoldest that I know of in summer, when, beside, shallow and stagnant\\r\\nsurface water is not mingled with it. Moreover, in summer, Walden never\\r\\nbecomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun, on account\\r\\nof its depth. In the warmest weather I usually placed a pailful in my\\r\\ncellar, where it became cool in the night, and remained so during the\\r\\nday; though I also resorted to a spring in the neighborhood. It was as\\r\\ngood when a week old as the day it was dipped, and had no taste of the\\r\\npump. Whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond, needs\\r\\nonly bury a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to\\r\\nbe independent of the luxury of ice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been caught in Walden pickerel, one weighing seven pounds,\\r\\nto say nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity,\\r\\nwhich the fisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did not\\r\\nsee him, perch and pouts, some of each weighing over two pounds,\\r\\nshiners, chivins or roach (_Leuciscus pulchellus_), a very few breams,\\r\\nand a couple of eels, one weighing four pounds,—I am thus particular\\r\\nbecause the weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame, and\\r\\nthese are the only eels I have heard of here;—also, I have a faint\\r\\nrecollection of a little fish some five inches long, with silvery sides\\r\\nand a greenish back, somewhat dace-like in its character, which I\\r\\nmention here chiefly to link my facts to fable. Nevertheless, this pond\\r\\nis not very fertile in fish. Its pickerel, though not abundant, are its\\r\\nchief boast. I have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at\\r\\nleast three different kinds; a long and shallow one, steel-colored,\\r\\nmost like those caught in the river; a bright golden kind, with\\r\\ngreenish reflections and remarkably deep, which is the most common\\r\\nhere; and another, golden-colored, and shaped like the last, but\\r\\npeppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots, intermixed\\r\\nwith a few faint blood-red ones, very much like a trout. The specific\\r\\nname _reticulatus_ would not apply to this; it should be _guttatus_\\r\\nrather. These are all very firm fish, and weigh more than their size\\r\\npromises. The shiners, pouts, and perch also, and indeed all the fishes\\r\\nwhich inhabit this pond, are much cleaner, handsomer, and firmer\\r\\nfleshed than those in the river and most other ponds, as the water is\\r\\npurer, and they can easily be distinguished from them. Probably many\\r\\nichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them. There are also\\r\\na clean race of frogs and tortoises, and a few muscels in it; muskrats\\r\\nand minks leave their traces about it, and occasionally a travelling\\r\\nmud-turtle visits it. Sometimes, when I pushed off my boat in the\\r\\nmorning, I disturbed a great mud-turtle which had secreted himself\\r\\nunder the boat in the night. Ducks and geese frequent it in the spring\\r\\nand fall, the white-bellied swallows (_Hirundo bicolor_) skim over it,\\r\\nand the peetweets (_Totanus macularius_) “teter” along its stony shores\\r\\nall summer. I have sometimes disturbed a fishhawk sitting on a\\r\\nwhite-pine over the water; but I doubt if it is ever profaned by the\\r\\nwing of a gull, like Fair Haven. At most, it tolerates one annual loon.\\r\\nThese are all the animals of consequence which frequent it now.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may see from a boat, in calm weather, near the sandy eastern shore,\\r\\nwhere the water is eight or ten feet deep, and also in some other parts\\r\\nof the pond, some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a\\r\\nfoot in height, consisting of small stones less than a hen’s egg in\\r\\nsize, where all around is bare sand. At first you wonder if the Indians\\r\\ncould have formed them on the ice for any purpose, and so, when the ice\\r\\nmelted, they sank to the bottom; but they are too regular and some of\\r\\nthem plainly too fresh for that. They are similar to those found in\\r\\nrivers; but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here, I know not by\\r\\nwhat fish they could be made. Perhaps they are the nests of the chivin.\\r\\nThese lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous. I have in my mind’s\\r\\neye the western indented with deep bays, the bolder northern, and the\\r\\nbeautifully scalloped southern shore, where successive capes overlap\\r\\neach other and suggest unexplored coves between. The forest has never\\r\\nso good a setting, nor is so distinctly beautiful, as when seen from\\r\\nthe middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the water’s edge;\\r\\nfor the water in which it is reflected not only makes the best\\r\\nforeground in such a case, but, with its winding shore, the most\\r\\nnatural and agreeable boundary to it. There is no rawness nor\\r\\nimperfection in its edge there, as where the axe has cleared a part, or\\r\\na cultivated field abuts on it. The trees have ample room to expand on\\r\\nthe water side, and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in that\\r\\ndirection. There Nature has woven a natural selvage, and the eye rises\\r\\nby just gradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highest\\r\\ntrees. There are few traces of man’s hand to be seen. The water laves\\r\\nthe shore as it did a thousand years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lake is the landscape’s most beautiful and expressive feature. It is\\r\\nearth’s eye; looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his\\r\\nown nature. The fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender\\r\\neyelashes which fringe it, and the wooded hills and cliffs around are\\r\\nits overhanging brows.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond, in a\\r\\ncalm September afternoon, when a slight haze makes the opposite shore\\r\\nline indistinct, I have seen whence came the expression, “the glassy\\r\\nsurface of a lake.” When you invert your head, it looks like a thread\\r\\nof finest gossamer stretched across the valley, and gleaming against\\r\\nthe distant pine woods, separating one stratum of the atmosphere from\\r\\nanother. You would think that you could walk dry under it to the\\r\\nopposite hills, and that the swallows which skim over might perch on\\r\\nit. Indeed, they sometimes dive below this line, as it were by mistake,\\r\\nand are undeceived. As you look over the pond westward you are obliged\\r\\nto employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as\\r\\nwell as the true sun, for they are equally bright; and if, between the\\r\\ntwo, you survey its surface critically, it is literally as smooth as\\r\\nglass, except where the skater insects, at equal intervals scattered\\r\\nover its whole extent, by their motions in the sun produce the finest\\r\\nimaginable sparkle on it, or, perchance, a duck plumes itself, or, as I\\r\\nhave said, a swallow skims so low as to touch it. It may be that in the\\r\\ndistance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air, and\\r\\nthere is one bright flash where it emerges, and another where it\\r\\nstrikes the water; sometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed; or here\\r\\nand there, perhaps, is a thistle-down floating on its surface, which\\r\\nthe fishes dart at and so dimple it again. It is like molten glass\\r\\ncooled but not congealed, and the few motes in it are pure and\\r\\nbeautiful like the imperfections in glass. You may often detect a yet\\r\\nsmoother and darker water, separated from the rest as if by an\\r\\ninvisible cobweb, boom of the water nymphs, resting on it. From a\\r\\nhill-top you can see a fish leap in almost any part; for not a pickerel\\r\\nor shiner picks an insect from this smooth surface but it manifestly\\r\\ndisturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake. It is wonderful with what\\r\\nelaborateness this simple fact is advertised,—this piscine murder will\\r\\nout,—and from my distant perch I distinguish the circling undulations\\r\\nwhen they are half a dozen rods in diameter. You can even detect a\\r\\nwater-bug (_Gyrinus_) ceaselessly progressing over the smooth surface a\\r\\nquarter of a mile off; for they furrow the water slightly, making a\\r\\nconspicuous ripple bounded by two diverging lines, but the skaters\\r\\nglide over it without rippling it perceptibly. When the surface is\\r\\nconsiderably agitated there are no skaters nor water-bugs on it, but\\r\\napparently, in calm days, they leave their havens and adventurously\\r\\nglide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely cover\\r\\nit. It is a soothing employment, on one of those fine days in the fall\\r\\nwhen all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated, to sit on a stump\\r\\non such a height as this, overlooking the pond, and study the dimpling\\r\\ncircles which are incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible\\r\\nsurface amid the reflected skies and trees. Over this great expanse\\r\\nthere is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away and\\r\\nassuaged, as, when a vase of water is jarred, the trembling circles\\r\\nseek the shore and all is smooth again. Not a fish can leap or an\\r\\ninsect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling dimples, in\\r\\nlines of beauty, as it were the constant welling up of its fountain,\\r\\nthe gentle pulsing of its life, the heaving of its breast. The thrills\\r\\nof joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable. How peaceful the\\r\\nphenomena of the lake! Again the works of man shine as in the spring.\\r\\nAy, every leaf and twig and stone and cobweb sparkles now at\\r\\nmid-afternoon as when covered with dew in a spring morning. Every\\r\\nmotion of an oar or an insect produces a flash of light; and if an oar\\r\\nfalls, how sweet the echo!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn such a day, in September or October, Walden is a perfect forest\\r\\nmirror, set round with stones as precious to my eye as if fewer or\\r\\nrarer. Nothing so fair, so pure, and at the same time so large, as a\\r\\nlake, perchance, lies on the surface of the earth. Sky water. It needs\\r\\nno fence. Nations come and go without defiling it. It is a mirror which\\r\\nno stone can crack, whose quicksilver will never wear off, whose\\r\\ngilding Nature continually repairs; no storms, no dust, can dim its\\r\\nsurface ever fresh;—a mirror in which all impurity presented to it\\r\\nsinks, swept and dusted by the sun’s hazy brush,—this the light\\r\\ndust-cloth,—which retains no breath that is breathed on it, but sends\\r\\nits own to float as clouds high above its surface, and be reflected in\\r\\nits bosom still.\\r\\n\\r\\nA field of water betrays the spirit that is in the air. It is\\r\\ncontinually receiving new life and motion from above. It is\\r\\nintermediate in its nature between land and sky. On land only the grass\\r\\nand trees wave, but the water itself is rippled by the wind. I see\\r\\nwhere the breeze dashes across it by the streaks or flakes of light. It\\r\\nis remarkable that we can look down on its surface. We shall, perhaps,\\r\\nlook down thus on the surface of air at length, and mark where a still\\r\\nsubtler spirit sweeps over it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skaters and water-bugs finally disappear in the latter part of\\r\\nOctober, when the severe frosts have come; and then and in November,\\r\\nusually, in a calm day, there is absolutely nothing to ripple the\\r\\nsurface. One November afternoon, in the calm at the end of a rain storm\\r\\nof several days’ duration, when the sky was still completely overcast\\r\\nand the air was full of mist, I observed that the pond was remarkably\\r\\nsmooth, so that it was difficult to distinguish its surface; though it\\r\\nno longer reflected the bright tints of October, but the sombre\\r\\nNovember colors of the surrounding hills. Though I passed over it as\\r\\ngently as possible, the slight undulations produced by my boat extended\\r\\nalmost as far as I could see, and gave a ribbed appearance to the\\r\\nreflections. But, as I was looking over the surface, I saw here and\\r\\nthere at a distance a faint glimmer, as if some skater insects which\\r\\nhad escaped the frosts might be collected there, or, perchance, the\\r\\nsurface, being so smooth, betrayed where a spring welled up from the\\r\\nbottom. Paddling gently to one of these places, I was surprised to find\\r\\nmyself surrounded by myriads of small perch, about five inches long, of\\r\\na rich bronze color in the green water, sporting there, and constantly\\r\\nrising to the surface and dimpling it, sometimes leaving bubbles on it.\\r\\nIn such transparent and seemingly bottomless water, reflecting the\\r\\nclouds, I seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon, and\\r\\ntheir swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering, as if they\\r\\nwere a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the\\r\\nright or left, their fins, like sails, set all around them. There were\\r\\nmany such schools in the pond, apparently improving the short season\\r\\nbefore winter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight,\\r\\nsometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze\\r\\nstruck it, or a few rain-drops fell there. When I approached carelessly\\r\\nand alarmed them, they made a sudden splash and rippling with their\\r\\ntails, as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough, and\\r\\ninstantly took refuge in the depths. At length the wind rose, the mist\\r\\nincreased, and the waves began to run, and the perch leaped much higher\\r\\nthan before, half out of water, a hundred black points, three inches\\r\\nlong, at once above the surface. Even as late as the fifth of December,\\r\\none year, I saw some dimples on the surface, and thinking it was going\\r\\nto rain hard immediately, the air being full of mist, I made haste to\\r\\ntake my place at the oars and row homeward; already the rain seemed\\r\\nrapidly increasing, though I felt none on my cheek, and I anticipated a\\r\\nthorough soaking. But suddenly the dimples ceased, for they were\\r\\nproduced by the perch, which the noise of my oars had seared into the\\r\\ndepths, and I saw their schools dimly disappearing; so I spent a dry\\r\\nafternoon after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago, when\\r\\nit was dark with surrounding forests, tells me that in those days he\\r\\nsometimes saw it all alive with ducks and other water fowl, and that\\r\\nthere were many eagles about it. He came here a-fishing, and used an\\r\\nold log canoe which he found on the shore. It was made of two\\r\\nwhite-pine logs dug out and pinned together, and was cut off square at\\r\\nthe ends. It was very clumsy, but lasted a great many years before it\\r\\nbecame water-logged and perhaps sank to the bottom. He did not know\\r\\nwhose it was; it belonged to the pond. He used to make a cable for his\\r\\nanchor of strips of hickory bark tied together. An old man, a potter,\\r\\nwho lived by the pond before the Revolution, told him once that there\\r\\nwas an iron chest at the bottom, and that he had seen it. Sometimes it\\r\\nwould come floating up to the shore; but when you went toward it, it\\r\\nwould go back into deep water and disappear. I was pleased to hear of\\r\\nthe old log canoe, which took the place of an Indian one of the same\\r\\nmaterial but more graceful construction, which perchance had first been\\r\\na tree on the bank, and then, as it were, fell into the water, to float\\r\\nthere for a generation, the most proper vessel for the lake. I remember\\r\\nthat when I first looked into these depths there were many large trunks\\r\\nto be seen indistinctly lying on the bottom, which had either been\\r\\nblown over formerly, or left on the ice at the last cutting, when wood\\r\\nwas cheaper; but now they have mostly disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I first paddled a boat on Walden, it was completely surrounded by\\r\\nthick and lofty pine and oak woods, and in some of its coves grape\\r\\nvines had run over the trees next the water and formed bowers under\\r\\nwhich a boat could pass. The hills which form its shores are so steep,\\r\\nand the woods on them were then so high, that, as you looked down from\\r\\nthe west end, it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some kind of\\r\\nsylvan spectacle. I have spent many an hour, when I was younger,\\r\\nfloating over its surface as the zephyr willed, having paddled my boat\\r\\nto the middle, and lying on my back across the seats, in a summer\\r\\nforenoon, dreaming awake, until I was aroused by the boat touching the\\r\\nsand, and I arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to; days\\r\\nwhen idleness was the most attractive and productive industry. Many a\\r\\nforenoon have I stolen away, preferring to spend thus the most valued\\r\\npart of the day; for I was rich, if not in money, in sunny hours and\\r\\nsummer days, and spent them lavishly; nor do I regret that I did not\\r\\nwaste more of them in the workshop or the teacher’s desk. But since I\\r\\nleft those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste,\\r\\nand now for many a year there will be no more rambling through the\\r\\naisles of the wood, with occasional vistas through which you see the\\r\\nwater. My Muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth. How can you\\r\\nexpect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the trunks of trees on the bottom, and the old log canoe, and the\\r\\ndark surrounding woods, are gone, and the villagers, who scarcely know\\r\\nwhere it lies, instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink, are\\r\\nthinking to bring its water, which should be as sacred as the Ganges at\\r\\nleast, to the village in a pipe, to wash their dishes with!—to earn\\r\\ntheir Walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug! That\\r\\ndevilish Iron Horse, whose ear-rending neigh is heard throughout the\\r\\ntown, has muddied the Boiling Spring with his foot, and he it is that\\r\\nhas browsed off all the woods on Walden shore, that Trojan horse, with\\r\\na thousand men in his belly, introduced by mercenary Greeks! Where is\\r\\nthe country’s champion, the Moore of Moore Hill, to meet him at the\\r\\nDeep Cut and thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloated\\r\\npest?\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, of all the characters I have known, perhaps Walden wears\\r\\nbest, and best preserves its purity. Many men have been likened to it,\\r\\nbut few deserve that honor. Though the woodchoppers have laid bare\\r\\nfirst this shore and then that, and the Irish have built their sties by\\r\\nit, and the railroad has infringed on its border, and the ice-men have\\r\\nskimmed it once, it is itself unchanged, the same water which my\\r\\nyouthful eyes fell on; all the change is in me. It has not acquired one\\r\\npermanent wrinkle after all its ripples. It is perennially young, and I\\r\\nmay stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its\\r\\nsurface as of yore. It struck me again tonight, as if I had not seen it\\r\\nalmost daily for more than twenty years,—Why, here is Walden, the same\\r\\nwoodland lake that I discovered so many years ago; where a forest was\\r\\ncut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as\\r\\never; the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then; it\\r\\nis the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its Maker, ay, and\\r\\nit _may_ be to me. It is the work of a brave man surely, in whom there\\r\\nwas no guile! He rounded this water with his hand, deepened and\\r\\nclarified it in his thought, and in his will bequeathed it to Concord.\\r\\nI see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection; and I can\\r\\nalmost say, Walden, is it you?\\r\\n\\r\\n     It is no dream of mine,\\r\\n     To ornament a line;\\r\\n     I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven\\r\\n     Than I live to Walden even.\\r\\n     I am its stony shore,\\r\\n     And the breeze that passes o’er;\\r\\n     In the hollow of my hand\\r\\n     Are its water and its sand,\\r\\n     And its deepest resort\\r\\n     Lies high in my thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cars never pause to look at it; yet I fancy that the engineers and\\r\\nfiremen and brakemen, and those passengers who have a season ticket and\\r\\nsee it often, are better men for the sight. The engineer does not\\r\\nforget at night, or his nature does not, that he has beheld this vision\\r\\nof serenity and purity once at least during the day. Though seen but\\r\\nonce, it helps to wash out State-street and the engine’s soot. One\\r\\nproposes that it be called “God’s Drop.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI have said that Walden has no visible inlet nor outlet, but it is on\\r\\nthe one hand distantly and indirectly related to Flint’s Pond, which is\\r\\nmore elevated, by a chain of small ponds coming from that quarter, and\\r\\non the other directly and manifestly to Concord River, which is lower,\\r\\nby a similar chain of ponds through which in some other geological\\r\\nperiod it may have flowed, and by a little digging, which God forbid,\\r\\nit can be made to flow thither again. If by living thus reserved and\\r\\naustere, like a hermit in the woods, so long, it has acquired such\\r\\nwonderful purity, who would not regret that the comparatively impure\\r\\nwaters of Flint’s Pond should be mingled with it, or itself should ever\\r\\ngo to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFlint’s, or Sandy Pond, in Lincoln, our greatest lake and inland sea,\\r\\nlies about a mile east of Walden. It is much larger, being said to\\r\\ncontain one hundred and ninety-seven acres, and is more fertile in\\r\\nfish; but it is comparatively shallow, and not remarkably pure. A walk\\r\\nthrough the woods thither was often my recreation. It was worth the\\r\\nwhile, if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely, and see the\\r\\nwaves run, and remember the life of mariners. I went a-chestnutting\\r\\nthere in the fall, on windy days, when the nuts were dropping into the\\r\\nwater and were washed to my feet; and one day, as I crept along its\\r\\nsedgy shore, the fresh spray blowing in my face, I came upon the\\r\\nmouldering wreck of a boat, the sides gone, and hardly more than the\\r\\nimpression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes; yet its model was\\r\\nsharply defined, as if it were a large decayed pad, with its veins. It\\r\\nwas as impressive a wreck as one could imagine on the sea-shore, and\\r\\nhad as good a moral. It is by this time mere vegetable mould and\\r\\nundistinguishable pond shore, through which rushes and flags have\\r\\npushed up. I used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom, at\\r\\nthe north end of this pond, made firm and hard to the feet of the wader\\r\\nby the pressure of the water, and the rushes which grew in Indian file,\\r\\nin waving lines, corresponding to these marks, rank behind rank, as if\\r\\nthe waves had planted them. There also I have found, in considerable\\r\\nquantities, curious balls, composed apparently of fine grass or roots,\\r\\nof pipewort perhaps, from half an inch to four inches in diameter, and\\r\\nperfectly spherical. These wash back and forth in shallow water on a\\r\\nsandy bottom, and are sometimes cast on the shore. They are either\\r\\nsolid grass, or have a little sand in the middle. At first you would\\r\\nsay that they were formed by the action of the waves, like a pebble;\\r\\nyet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials, half an inch\\r\\nlong, and they are produced only at one season of the year. Moreover,\\r\\nthe waves, I suspect, do not so much construct as wear down a material\\r\\nwhich has already acquired consistency. They preserve their form when\\r\\ndry for an indefinite period.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Flint’s Pond!_ Such is the poverty of our nomenclature. What right had\\r\\nthe unclean and stupid farmer, whose farm abutted on this sky water,\\r\\nwhose shores he has ruthlessly laid bare, to give his name to it? Some\\r\\nskin-flint, who loved better the reflecting surface of a dollar, or a\\r\\nbright cent, in which he could see his own brazen face; who regarded\\r\\neven the wild ducks which settled in it as trespassers; his fingers\\r\\ngrown into crooked and horny talons from the long habit of grasping\\r\\nharpy-like;—so it is not named for me. I go not there to see him nor to\\r\\nhear of him; who never _saw_ it, who never bathed in it, who never\\r\\nloved it, who never protected it, who never spoke a good word for it,\\r\\nnor thanked God that he had made it. Rather let it be named from the\\r\\nfishes that swim in it, the wild fowl or quadrupeds which frequent it,\\r\\nthe wild flowers which grow by its shores, or some wild man or child\\r\\nthe thread of whose history is interwoven with its own; not from him\\r\\nwho could show no title to it but the deed which a like-minded neighbor\\r\\nor legislature gave him,—him who thought only of its money value; whose\\r\\npresence perchance cursed all the shore; who exhausted the land around\\r\\nit, and would fain have exhausted the waters within it; who regretted\\r\\nonly that it was not English hay or cranberry meadow,—there was nothing\\r\\nto redeem it, forsooth, in his eyes,—and would have drained and sold it\\r\\nfor the mud at its bottom. It did not turn his mill, and it was no\\r\\n_privilege_ to him to behold it. I respect not his labors, his farm\\r\\nwhere every thing has its price; who would carry the landscape, who\\r\\nwould carry his God, to market, if he could get any thing for him; who\\r\\ngoes to market _for_ his god as it is; on whose farm nothing grows\\r\\nfree, whose fields bear no crops, whose meadows no flowers, whose trees\\r\\nno fruits, but dollars; who loves not the beauty of his fruits, whose\\r\\nfruits are not ripe for him till they are turned to dollars. Give me\\r\\nthe poverty that enjoys true wealth. Farmers are respectable and\\r\\ninteresting to me in proportion as they are poor,—poor farmers. A model\\r\\nfarm! where the house stands like a fungus in a muck-heap, chambers for\\r\\nmen, horses, oxen, and swine, cleansed and uncleansed, all contiguous\\r\\nto one another! Stocked with men! A great grease-spot, redolent of\\r\\nmanures and buttermilk! Under a high state of cultivation, being\\r\\nmanured with the hearts and brains of men! As if you were to raise your\\r\\npotatoes in the church-yard! Such is a model farm.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, no; if the fairest features of the landscape are to be named after\\r\\nmen, let them be the noblest and worthiest men alone. Let our lakes\\r\\nreceive as true names at least as the Icarian Sea, where “still the\\r\\nshore” a “brave attempt resounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGoose Pond, of small extent, is on my way to Flint’s; Fair-Haven, an\\r\\nexpansion of Concord River, said to contain some seventy acres, is a\\r\\nmile south-west; and White Pond, of about forty acres, is a mile and a\\r\\nhalf beyond Fair-Haven. This is my lake country. These, with Concord\\r\\nRiver, are my water privileges; and night and day, year in year out,\\r\\nthey grind such grist as I carry to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the woodcutters, and the railroad, and I myself have profaned\\r\\nWalden, perhaps the most attractive, if not the most beautiful, of all\\r\\nour lakes, the gem of the woods, is White Pond;—a poor name from its\\r\\ncommonness, whether derived from the remarkable purity of its waters or\\r\\nthe color of its sands. In these as in other respects, however, it is a\\r\\nlesser twin of Walden. They are so much alike that you would say they\\r\\nmust be connected under ground. It has the same stony shore, and its\\r\\nwaters are of the same hue. As at Walden, in sultry dog-day weather,\\r\\nlooking down through the woods on some of its bays which are not so\\r\\ndeep but that the reflection from the bottom tinges them, its waters\\r\\nare of a misty bluish-green or glaucous color. Many years since I used\\r\\nto go there to collect the sand by cart-loads, to make sand-paper with,\\r\\nand I have continued to visit it ever since. One who frequents it\\r\\nproposes to call it Virid Lake. Perhaps it might be called Yellow-Pine\\r\\nLake, from the following circumstance. About fifteen years ago you\\r\\ncould see the top of a pitch-pine, of the kind called yellow-pine\\r\\nhereabouts, though it is not a distinct species, projecting above the\\r\\nsurface in deep water, many rods from the shore. It was even supposed\\r\\nby some that the pond had sunk, and this was one of the primitive\\r\\nforest that formerly stood there. I find that even so long ago as 1792,\\r\\nin a “Topographical Description of the Town of Concord,” by one of its\\r\\ncitizens, in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society,\\r\\nthe author, after speaking of Walden and White Ponds, adds: “In the\\r\\nmiddle of the latter may be seen, when the water is very low, a tree\\r\\nwhich appears as if it grew in the place where it now stands, although\\r\\nthe roots are fifty feet below the surface of the water; the top of\\r\\nthis tree is broken off, and at that place measures fourteen inches in\\r\\ndiameter.” In the spring of ’49 I talked with the man who lives nearest\\r\\nthe pond in Sudbury, who told me that it was he who got out this tree\\r\\nten or fifteen years before. As near as he could remember, it stood\\r\\ntwelve or fifteen rods from the shore, where the water was thirty or\\r\\nforty feet deep. It was in the winter, and he had been getting out ice\\r\\nin the forenoon, and had resolved that in the afternoon, with the aid\\r\\nof his neighbors, he would take out the old yellow-pine. He sawed a\\r\\nchannel in the ice toward the shore, and hauled it over and along and\\r\\nout on to the ice with oxen; but, before he had gone far in his work,\\r\\nhe was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward, with the stumps\\r\\nof the branches pointing down, and the small end firmly fastened in the\\r\\nsandy bottom. It was about a foot in diameter at the big end, and he\\r\\nhad expected to get a good saw-log, but it was so rotten as to be fit\\r\\nonly for fuel, if for that. He had some of it in his shed then. There\\r\\nwere marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the butt. He thought that it\\r\\nmight have been a dead tree on the shore, but was finally blown over\\r\\ninto the pond, and after the top had become waterlogged, while the\\r\\nbutt-end was still dry and light, had drifted out and sunk wrong end\\r\\nup. His father, eighty years old, could not remember when it was not\\r\\nthere. Several pretty large logs may still be seen lying on the bottom,\\r\\nwhere, owing to the undulation of the surface, they look like huge\\r\\nwater snakes in motion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis pond has rarely been profaned by a boat, for there is little in it\\r\\nto tempt a fisherman. Instead of the white lily, which requires mud, or\\r\\nthe common sweet flag, the blue flag (_Iris versicolor_) grows thinly\\r\\nin the pure water, rising from the stony bottom all around the shore,\\r\\nwhere it is visited by humming birds in June; and the color both of its\\r\\nbluish blades and its flowers, and especially their reflections, are in\\r\\nsingular harmony with the glaucous water.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite Pond and Walden are great crystals on the surface of the earth,\\r\\nLakes of Light. If they were permanently congealed, and small enough to\\r\\nbe clutched, they would, perchance, be carried off by slaves, like\\r\\nprecious stones, to adorn the heads of emperors; but being liquid, and\\r\\nample, and secured to us and our successors forever, we disregard them,\\r\\nand run after the diamond of Kohinoor. They are too pure to have a\\r\\nmarket value; they contain no muck. How much more beautiful than our\\r\\nlives, how much more transparent than our characters, are they! We\\r\\nnever learned meanness of them. How much fairer than the pool before\\r\\nthe farmer’s door, in which his ducks swim! Hither the clean wild ducks\\r\\ncome. Nature has no human inhabitant who appreciates her. The birds\\r\\nwith their plumage and their notes are in harmony with the flowers, but\\r\\nwhat youth or maiden conspires with the wild luxuriant beauty of\\r\\nNature? She flourishes most alone, far from the towns where they\\r\\nreside. Talk of heaven! ye disgrace earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaker Farm\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes I rambled to pine groves, standing like temples, or like\\r\\nfleets at sea, full-rigged, with wavy boughs, and rippling with light,\\r\\nso soft and green and shady that the Druids would have forsaken their\\r\\noaks to worship in them; or to the cedar wood beyond Flint’s Pond,\\r\\nwhere the trees, covered with hoary blue berries, spiring higher and\\r\\nhigher, are fit to stand before Valhalla, and the creeping juniper\\r\\ncovers the ground with wreaths full of fruit; or to swamps where the\\r\\nusnea lichen hangs in festoons from the white-spruce trees, and\\r\\ntoad-stools, round tables of the swamp gods, cover the ground, and more\\r\\nbeautiful fungi adorn the stumps, like butterflies or shells, vegetable\\r\\nwinkles; where the swamp-pink and dogwood grow, the red alder-berry\\r\\nglows like eyes of imps, the waxwork grooves and crushes the hardest\\r\\nwoods in its folds, and the wild-holly berries make the beholder forget\\r\\nhis home with their beauty, and he is dazzled and tempted by nameless\\r\\nother wild forbidden fruits, too fair for mortal taste. Instead of\\r\\ncalling on some scholar, I paid many a visit to particular trees, of\\r\\nkinds which are rare in this neighborhood, standing far away in the\\r\\nmiddle of some pasture, or in the depths of a wood or swamp, or on a\\r\\nhill-top; such as the black-birch, of which we have some handsome\\r\\nspecimens two feet in diameter; its cousin, the yellow birch, with its\\r\\nloose golden vest, perfumed like the first; the beech, which has so\\r\\nneat a bole and beautifully lichen-painted, perfect in all its details,\\r\\nof which, excepting scattered specimens, I know but one small grove of\\r\\nsizable trees left in the township, supposed by some to have been\\r\\nplanted by the pigeons that were once baited with beech nuts near by;\\r\\nit is worth the while to see the silver grain sparkle when you split\\r\\nthis wood; the bass; the hornbeam; the _Celtis occidentalis_, or false\\r\\nelm, of which we have but one well-grown; some taller mast of a pine, a\\r\\nshingle tree, or a more perfect hemlock than usual, standing like a\\r\\npagoda in the midst of the woods; and many others I could mention.\\r\\nThese were the shrines I visited both summer and winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce it chanced that I stood in the very abutment of a rainbow’s arch,\\r\\nwhich filled the lower stratum of the atmosphere, tinging the grass and\\r\\nleaves around, and dazzling me as if I looked through colored crystal.\\r\\nIt was a lake of rainbow light, in which, for a short while, I lived\\r\\nlike a dolphin. If it had lasted longer it might have tinged my\\r\\nemployments and life. As I walked on the railroad causeway, I used to\\r\\nwonder at the halo of light around my shadow, and would fain fancy\\r\\nmyself one of the elect. One who visited me declared that the shadows\\r\\nof some Irishmen before him had no halo about them, that it was only\\r\\nnatives that were so distinguished. Benvenuto Cellini tells us in his\\r\\nmemoirs, that, after a certain terrible dream or vision which he had\\r\\nduring his confinement in the castle of St. Angelo, a resplendent light\\r\\nappeared over the shadow of his head at morning and evening, whether he\\r\\nwas in Italy or France, and it was particularly conspicuous when the\\r\\ngrass was moist with dew. This was probably the same phenomenon to\\r\\nwhich I have referred, which is especially observed in the morning, but\\r\\nalso at other times, and even by moonlight. Though a constant one, it\\r\\nis not commonly noticed, and, in the case of an excitable imagination\\r\\nlike Cellini’s, it would be basis enough for superstition. Beside, he\\r\\ntells us that he showed it to very few. But are they not indeed\\r\\ndistinguished who are conscious that they are regarded at all?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI set out one afternoon to go a-fishing to Fair-Haven, through the\\r\\nwoods, to eke out my scanty fare of vegetables. My way led through\\r\\nPleasant Meadow, an adjunct of the Baker Farm, that retreat of which a\\r\\npoet has since sung, beginning,—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Thy entry is a pleasant field,\\r\\n     Which some mossy fruit trees yield\\r\\n     Partly to a ruddy brook,\\r\\n     By gliding musquash undertook,\\r\\n     And mercurial trout,\\r\\n     Darting about.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought of living there before I went to Walden. I “hooked” the\\r\\napples, leaped the brook, and scared the musquash and the trout. It was\\r\\none of those afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one, in\\r\\nwhich many events may happen, a large portion of our natural life,\\r\\nthough it was already half spent when I started. By the way there came\\r\\nup a shower, which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pine,\\r\\npiling boughs over my head, and wearing my handkerchief for a shed; and\\r\\nwhen at length I had made one cast over the pickerel-weed, standing up\\r\\nto my middle in water, I found myself suddenly in the shadow of a\\r\\ncloud, and the thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that I could\\r\\ndo no more than listen to it. The gods must be proud, thought I, with\\r\\nsuch forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste\\r\\nfor shelter to the nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road,\\r\\nbut so much the nearer to the pond, and had long been uninhabited:—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “And here a poet builded,\\r\\n         In the completed years,\\r\\n     For behold a trivial cabin\\r\\n         That to destruction steers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an\\r\\nIrishman, and his wife, and several children, from the broad-faced boy\\r\\nwho assisted his father at his work, and now came running by his side\\r\\nfrom the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like,\\r\\ncone-headed infant that sat upon its father’s knee as in the palaces of\\r\\nnobles, and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger\\r\\ninquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not\\r\\nknowing but it was the last of a noble line, and the hope and cynosure\\r\\nof the world, instead of John Field’s poor starveling brat. There we\\r\\nsat together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while\\r\\nit showered and thundered without. I had sat there many times of old\\r\\nbefore the ship was built that floated his family to America. An\\r\\nhonest, hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his\\r\\nwife, she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the\\r\\nrecesses of that lofty stove; with round greasy face and bare breast,\\r\\nstill thinking to improve her condition one day; with the never absent\\r\\nmop in one hand, and yet no effects of it visible anywhere. The\\r\\nchickens, which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked\\r\\nabout the room like members of the family, too humanized methought to\\r\\nroast well. They stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe\\r\\nsignificantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked\\r\\n“bogging” for a neighboring farmer, turning up a meadow with a spade or\\r\\nbog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with\\r\\nmanure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully\\r\\nat his father’s side the while, not knowing how poor a bargain the\\r\\nlatter had made. I tried to help him with my experience, telling him\\r\\nthat he was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came\\r\\na-fishing here, and looked like a loafer, was getting my living like\\r\\nhimself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which hardly\\r\\ncost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts\\r\\nto; and how, if he chose, he might in a month or two build himself a\\r\\npalace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter, nor\\r\\nmilk, nor fresh meat, and so did not have to work to get them; again,\\r\\nas I did not work hard, I did not have to eat hard, and it cost me but\\r\\na trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter,\\r\\nand milk, and beef, he had to work hard to pay for them, and when he\\r\\nhad worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his\\r\\nsystem,—and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader\\r\\nthan it was long, for he was discontented and wasted his life into the\\r\\nbargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to America, that\\r\\nhere you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only\\r\\ntrue America is that country where you are at liberty to pursue such a\\r\\nmode of life as may enable you to do without these, and where the state\\r\\ndoes not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and\\r\\nother superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from the\\r\\nuse of such things. For I purposely talked to him as if he were a\\r\\nphilosopher, or desired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows\\r\\non the earth were left in a wild state, if that were the consequence of\\r\\nmen’s beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study\\r\\nhistory to find out what is best for his own culture. But alas! the\\r\\nculture of an Irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a sort of\\r\\nmoral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so hard at bogging, he\\r\\nrequired thick boots and stout clothing, which yet were soon soiled and\\r\\nworn out, but I wore light shoes and thin clothing, which cost not half\\r\\nso much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman,\\r\\n(which, however, was not the case,) and in an hour or two, without\\r\\nlabor, but as a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch as many fish as\\r\\nI should want for two days, or earn enough money to support me a week.\\r\\nIf he and his family would live simply, they might all go\\r\\na-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement. John heaved a sigh\\r\\nat this, and his wife stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be\\r\\nwondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course with, or\\r\\narithmetic enough to carry it through. It was sailing by dead reckoning\\r\\nto them, and they saw not clearly how to make their port so; therefore\\r\\nI suppose they still take life bravely, after their fashion, face to\\r\\nface, giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive\\r\\ncolumns with any fine entering wedge, and rout it in detail;—thinking\\r\\nto deal with it roughly, as one should handle a thistle. But they fight\\r\\nat an overwhelming disadvantage,—living, John Field, alas! without\\r\\narithmetic, and failing so.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you ever fish?” I asked. “Oh yes, I catch a mess now and then when\\r\\nI am lying by; good perch I catch.” “What’s your bait?” “I catch\\r\\nshiners with fish-worms, and bait the perch with them.” “You’d better\\r\\ngo now, John,” said his wife, with glistening and hopeful face; but\\r\\nJohn demurred.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe shower was now over, and a rainbow above the eastern woods promised\\r\\na fair evening; so I took my departure. When I had got without I asked\\r\\nfor a drink, hoping to get a sight of the well bottom, to complete my\\r\\nsurvey of the premises; but there, alas! are shallows and quicksands,\\r\\nand rope broken withal, and bucket irrecoverable. Meanwhile the right\\r\\nculinary vessel was selected, water was seemingly distilled, and after\\r\\nconsultation and long delay passed out to the thirsty one,—not yet\\r\\nsuffered to cool, not yet to settle. Such gruel sustains life here, I\\r\\nthought; so, shutting my eyes, and excluding the motes by a skilfully\\r\\ndirected under-current, I drank to genuine hospitality the heartiest\\r\\ndraught I could. I am not squeamish in such cases when manners are\\r\\nconcerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was leaving the Irishman’s roof after the rain, bending my steps\\r\\nagain to the pond, my haste to catch pickerel, wading in retired\\r\\nmeadows, in sloughs and bog-holes, in forlorn and savage places,\\r\\nappeared for an instant trivial to me who had been sent to school and\\r\\ncollege; but as I ran down the hill toward the reddening west, with the\\r\\nrainbow over my shoulder, and some faint tinkling sounds borne to my\\r\\near through the cleansed air, from I know not what quarter, my Good\\r\\nGenius seemed to say,—Go fish and hunt far and wide day by day,—farther\\r\\nand wider,—and rest thee by many brooks and hearth-sides without\\r\\nmisgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Rise free\\r\\nfrom care before the dawn, and seek adventures. Let the noon find thee\\r\\nby other lakes, and the night overtake thee everywhere at home. There\\r\\nare no larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be\\r\\nplayed. Grow wild according to thy nature, like these sedges and\\r\\nbrakes, which will never become English hay. Let the thunder rumble;\\r\\nwhat if it threaten ruin to farmers’ crops? that is not its errand to\\r\\nthee. Take shelter under the cloud, while they flee to carts and sheds.\\r\\nLet not to get a living be thy trade, but thy sport. Enjoy the land,\\r\\nbut own it not. Through want of enterprise and faith men are where they\\r\\nare, buying and selling, and spending their lives like serfs.\\r\\n\\r\\nO Baker Farm!\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Landscape where the richest element\\r\\n     Is a little sunshine innocent.” * *\\r\\n\\r\\n     “No one runs to revel\\r\\n     On thy rail-fenced lea.” * *\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Debate with no man hast thou,\\r\\n         With questions art never perplexed,\\r\\n     As tame at the first sight as now,\\r\\n         In thy plain russet gabardine dressed.” * *\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Come ye who love,\\r\\n         And ye who hate,\\r\\n     Children of the Holy Dove,\\r\\n         And Guy Faux of the state,\\r\\n     And hang conspiracies\\r\\n     From the tough rafters of the trees!”\\r\\n\\r\\nMen come tamely home at night only from the next field or street, where\\r\\ntheir household echoes haunt, and their life pines because it breathes\\r\\nits own breath over again; their shadows morning and evening reach\\r\\nfarther than their daily steps. We should come home from far, from\\r\\nadventures, and perils, and discoveries every day, with new experience\\r\\nand character.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out John\\r\\nField, with altered mind, letting go “bogging” ere this sunset. But he,\\r\\npoor man, disturbed only a couple of fins while I was catching a fair\\r\\nstring, and he said it was his luck; but when we changed seats in the\\r\\nboat luck changed seats too. Poor John Field!—I trust he does not read\\r\\nthis, unless he will improve by it,—thinking to live by some derivative\\r\\nold country mode in this primitive new country,—to catch perch with\\r\\nshiners. It is good bait sometimes, I allow. With his horizon all his\\r\\nown, yet he a poor man, born to be poor, with his inherited Irish\\r\\npoverty or poor life, his Adam’s grandmother and boggy ways, not to\\r\\nrise in this world, he nor his posterity, till their wading webbed\\r\\nbog-trotting feet get _talaria_ to their heels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHigher Laws\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I came home through the woods with my string of fish, trailing my\\r\\npole, it being now quite dark, I caught a glimpse of a woodchuck\\r\\nstealing across my path, and felt a strange thrill of savage delight,\\r\\nand was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw; not that I was\\r\\nhungry then, except for that wildness which he represented. Once or\\r\\ntwice, however, while I lived at the pond, I found myself ranging the\\r\\nwoods, like a half-starved hound, with a strange abandonment, seeking\\r\\nsome kind of venison which I might devour, and no morsel could have\\r\\nbeen too savage for me. The wildest scenes had become unaccountably\\r\\nfamiliar. I found in myself, and still find, an instinct toward a\\r\\nhigher, or, as it is named, spiritual life, as do most men, and another\\r\\ntoward a primitive rank and savage one, and I reverence them both. I\\r\\nlove the wild not less than the good. The wildness and adventure that\\r\\nare in fishing still recommended it to me. I like sometimes to take\\r\\nrank hold on life and spend my day more as the animals do. Perhaps I\\r\\nhave owed to this employment and to hunting, when quite young, my\\r\\nclosest acquaintance with Nature. They early introduce us to and detain\\r\\nus in scenery with which otherwise, at that age, we should have little\\r\\nacquaintance. Fishermen, hunters, woodchoppers, and others, spending\\r\\ntheir lives in the fields and woods, in a peculiar sense a part of\\r\\nNature themselves, are often in a more favorable mood for observing\\r\\nher, in the intervals of their pursuits, than philosophers or poets\\r\\neven, who approach her with expectation. She is not afraid to exhibit\\r\\nherself to them. The traveller on the prairie is naturally a hunter, on\\r\\nthe head waters of the Missouri and Columbia a trapper, and at the\\r\\nFalls of St. Mary a fisherman. He who is only a traveller learns things\\r\\nat second-hand and by the halves, and is poor authority. We are most\\r\\ninterested when science reports what those men already know practically\\r\\nor instinctively, for that alone is a true _humanity_, or account of\\r\\nhuman experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey mistake who assert that the Yankee has few amusements, because he\\r\\nhas not so many public holidays, and men and boys do not play so many\\r\\ngames as they do in England, for here the more primitive but solitary\\r\\namusements of hunting fishing and the like have not yet given place to\\r\\nthe former. Almost every New England boy among my contemporaries\\r\\nshouldered a fowling piece between the ages of ten and fourteen; and\\r\\nhis hunting and fishing grounds were not limited, like the preserves of\\r\\nan English nobleman, but were more boundless even than those of a\\r\\nsavage. No wonder, then, that he did not oftener stay to play on the\\r\\ncommon. But already a change is taking place, owing, not to an\\r\\nincreased humanity, but to an increased scarcity of game, for perhaps\\r\\nthe hunter is the greatest friend of the animals hunted, not excepting\\r\\nthe Humane Society.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, when at the pond, I wished sometimes to add fish to my fare\\r\\nfor variety. I have actually fished from the same kind of necessity\\r\\nthat the first fishers did. Whatever humanity I might conjure up\\r\\nagainst it was all factitious, and concerned my philosophy more than my\\r\\nfeelings. I speak of fishing only now, for I had long felt differently\\r\\nabout fowling, and sold my gun before I went to the woods. Not that I\\r\\nam less humane than others, but I did not perceive that my feelings\\r\\nwere much affected. I did not pity the fishes nor the worms. This was\\r\\nhabit. As for fowling, during the last years that I carried a gun my\\r\\nexcuse was that I was studying ornithology, and sought only new or rare\\r\\nbirds. But I confess that I am now inclined to think that there is a\\r\\nfiner way of studying ornithology than this. It requires so much closer\\r\\nattention to the habits of the birds, that, if for that reason only, I\\r\\nhave been willing to omit the gun. Yet notwithstanding the objection on\\r\\nthe score of humanity, I am compelled to doubt if equally valuable\\r\\nsports are ever substituted for these; and when some of my friends have\\r\\nasked me anxiously about their boys, whether they should let them hunt,\\r\\nI have answered, yes,—remembering that it was one of the best parts of\\r\\nmy education,—_make_ them hunters, though sportsmen only at first, if\\r\\npossible, mighty hunters at last, so that they shall not find game\\r\\nlarge enough for them in this or any vegetable wilderness,—hunters as\\r\\nwell as fishers of men. Thus far I am of the opinion of Chaucer’s nun,\\r\\nwho\\r\\n\\r\\n     “yave not of the text a pulled hen\\r\\n     That saith that hunters ben not holy men.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a period in the history of the individual, as of the race,\\r\\nwhen the hunters are the “best men,” as the Algonquins called them. We\\r\\ncannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun; he is no more\\r\\nhumane, while his education has been sadly neglected. This was my\\r\\nanswer with respect to those youths who were bent on this pursuit,\\r\\ntrusting that they would soon outgrow it. No humane being, past the\\r\\nthoughtless age of boyhood, will wantonly murder any creature which\\r\\nholds its life by the same tenure that he does. The hare in its\\r\\nextremity cries like a child. I warn you, mothers, that my sympathies\\r\\ndo not always make the usual phil-_anthropic_ distinctions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is oftenest the young man’s introduction to the forest, and the\\r\\nmost original part of himself. He goes thither at first as a hunter and\\r\\nfisher, until at last, if he has the seeds of a better life in him, he\\r\\ndistinguishes his proper objects, as a poet or naturalist it may be,\\r\\nand leaves the gun and fish-pole behind. The mass of men are still and\\r\\nalways young in this respect. In some countries a hunting parson is no\\r\\nuncommon sight. Such a one might make a good shepherd’s dog, but is far\\r\\nfrom being the Good Shepherd. I have been surprised to consider that\\r\\nthe only obvious employment, except wood-chopping, ice-cutting, or the\\r\\nlike business, which ever to my knowledge detained at Walden Pond for a\\r\\nwhole half day any of my fellow-citizens, whether fathers or children\\r\\nof the town, with just one exception, was fishing. Commonly they did\\r\\nnot think that they were lucky, or well paid for their time, unless\\r\\nthey got a long string of fish, though they had the opportunity of\\r\\nseeing the pond all the while. They might go there a thousand times\\r\\nbefore the sediment of fishing would sink to the bottom and leave their\\r\\npurpose pure; but no doubt such a clarifying process would be going on\\r\\nall the while. The governor and his council faintly remember the pond,\\r\\nfor they went a-fishing there when they were boys; but now they are too\\r\\nold and dignified to go a-fishing, and so they know it no more forever.\\r\\nYet even they expect to go to heaven at last. If the legislature\\r\\nregards it, it is chiefly to regulate the number of hooks to be used\\r\\nthere; but they know nothing about the hook of hooks with which to\\r\\nangle for the pond itself, impaling the legislature for a bait. Thus,\\r\\neven in civilized communities, the embryo man passes through the hunter\\r\\nstage of development.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have found repeatedly, of late years, that I cannot fish without\\r\\nfalling a little in self-respect. I have tried it again and again. I\\r\\nhave skill at it, and, like many of my fellows, a certain instinct for\\r\\nit, which revives from time to time, but always when I have done I feel\\r\\nthat it would have been better if I had not fished. I think that I do\\r\\nnot mistake. It is a faint intimation, yet so are the first streaks of\\r\\nmorning. There is unquestionably this instinct in me which belongs to\\r\\nthe lower orders of creation; yet with every year I am less a\\r\\nfisherman, though without more humanity or even wisdom; at present I am\\r\\nno fisherman at all. But I see that if I were to live in a wilderness I\\r\\nshould again be tempted to become a fisher and hunter in earnest.\\r\\nBeside, there is something essentially unclean about this diet and all\\r\\nflesh, and I began to see where housework commences, and whence the\\r\\nendeavor, which costs so much, to wear a tidy and respectable\\r\\nappearance each day, to keep the house sweet and free from all ill\\r\\nodors and sights. Having been my own butcher and scullion and cook, as\\r\\nwell as the gentleman for whom the dishes were served up, I can speak\\r\\nfrom an unusually complete experience. The practical objection to\\r\\nanimal food in my case was its uncleanness; and, besides, when I had\\r\\ncaught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to\\r\\nhave fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost\\r\\nmore than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done\\r\\nas well, with less trouble and filth. Like many of my contemporaries, I\\r\\nhad rarely for many years used animal food, or tea, or coffee, &c.; not\\r\\nso much because of any ill effects which I had traced to them, as\\r\\nbecause they were not agreeable to my imagination. The repugnance to\\r\\nanimal food is not the effect of experience, but is an instinct. It\\r\\nappeared more beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects; and\\r\\nthough I never did so, I went far enough to please my imagination. I\\r\\nbelieve that every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higher\\r\\nor poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly\\r\\ninclined to abstain from animal food, and from much food of any kind.\\r\\nIt is a significant fact, stated by entomologists, I find it in Kirby\\r\\nand Spence, that “some insects in their perfect state, though furnished\\r\\nwith organs of feeding, make no use of them;” and they lay it down as\\r\\n“a general rule, that almost all insects in this state eat much less\\r\\nthan in that of larvæ. The voracious caterpillar when transformed into\\r\\na butterfly,” . . “and the gluttonous maggot when become a fly,”\\r\\ncontent themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweet\\r\\nliquid. The abdomen under the wings of the butterfly still represents\\r\\nthe larva. This is the tid-bit which tempts his insectivorous fate. The\\r\\ngross feeder is a man in the larva state; and there are whole nations\\r\\nin that condition, nations without fancy or imagination, whose vast\\r\\nabdomens betray them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will not\\r\\noffend the imagination; but this, I think, is to be fed when we feed\\r\\nthe body; they should both sit down at the same table. Yet perhaps this\\r\\nmay be done. The fruits eaten temperately need not make us ashamed of\\r\\nour appetites, nor interrupt the worthiest pursuits. But put an extra\\r\\ncondiment into your dish, and it will poison you. It is not worth the\\r\\nwhile to live by rich cookery. Most men would feel shame if caught\\r\\npreparing with their own hands precisely such a dinner, whether of\\r\\nanimal or vegetable food, as is every day prepared for them by others.\\r\\nYet till this is otherwise we are not civilized, and, if gentlemen and\\r\\nladies, are not true men and women. This certainly suggests what change\\r\\nis to be made. It may be vain to ask why the imagination will not be\\r\\nreconciled to flesh and fat. I am satisfied that it is not. Is it not a\\r\\nreproach that man is a carnivorous animal? True, he can and does live,\\r\\nin a great measure, by preying on other animals; but this is a\\r\\nmiserable way,—as any one who will go to snaring rabbits, or\\r\\nslaughtering lambs, may learn,—and he will be regarded as a benefactor\\r\\nof his race who shall teach man to confine himself to a more innocent\\r\\nand wholesome diet. Whatever my own practice may be, I have no doubt\\r\\nthat it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual\\r\\nimprovement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage\\r\\ntribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with\\r\\nthe more civilized.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius,\\r\\nwhich are certainly true, he sees not to what extremes, or even\\r\\ninsanity, it may lead him; and yet that way, as he grows more resolute\\r\\nand faithful, his road lies. The faintest assured objection which one\\r\\nhealthy man feels will at length prevail over the arguments and customs\\r\\nof mankind. No man ever followed his genius till it misled him. Though\\r\\nthe result were bodily weakness, yet perhaps no one can say that the\\r\\nconsequences were to be regretted, for these were a life in conformity\\r\\nto higher principles. If the day and the night are such that you greet\\r\\nthem with joy, and life emits a fragrance like flowers and\\r\\nsweet-scented herbs, is more elastic, more starry, more immortal,—that\\r\\nis your success. All nature is your congratulation, and you have cause\\r\\nmomentarily to bless yourself. The greatest gains and values are\\r\\nfarthest from being appreciated. We easily come to doubt if they exist.\\r\\nWe soon forget them. They are the highest reality. Perhaps the facts\\r\\nmost astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man. The\\r\\ntrue harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and\\r\\nindescribable as the tints of morning or evening. It is a little\\r\\nstar-dust caught, a segment of the rainbow which I have clutched.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, for my part, I was never unusually squeamish; I could sometimes\\r\\neat a fried rat with a good relish, if it were necessary. I am glad to\\r\\nhave drunk water so long, for the same reason that I prefer the natural\\r\\nsky to an opium-eater’s heaven. I would fain keep sober always; and\\r\\nthere are infinite degrees of drunkenness. I believe that water is the\\r\\nonly drink for a wise man; wine is not so noble a liquor; and think of\\r\\ndashing the hopes of a morning with a cup of warm coffee, or of an\\r\\nevening with a dish of tea! Ah, how low I fall when I am tempted by\\r\\nthem! Even music may be intoxicating. Such apparently slight causes\\r\\ndestroyed Greece and Rome, and will destroy England and America. Of all\\r\\nebriosity, who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he\\r\\nbreathes? I have found it to be the most serious objection to coarse\\r\\nlabors long continued, that they compelled me to eat and drink coarsely\\r\\nalso. But to tell the truth, I find myself at present somewhat less\\r\\nparticular in these respects. I carry less religion to the table, ask\\r\\nno blessing; not because I am wiser than I was, but, I am obliged to\\r\\nconfess, because, however much it is to be regretted, with years I have\\r\\ngrown more coarse and indifferent. Perhaps these questions are\\r\\nentertained only in youth, as most believe of poetry. My practice is\\r\\n“nowhere,” my opinion is here. Nevertheless I am far from regarding\\r\\nmyself as one of those privileged ones to whom the Ved refers when it\\r\\nsays, that “he who has true faith in the Omnipresent Supreme Being may\\r\\neat all that exists,” that is, is not bound to inquire what is his\\r\\nfood, or who prepares it; and even in their case it is to be observed,\\r\\nas a Hindoo commentator has remarked, that the Vedant limits this\\r\\nprivilege to “the time of distress.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWho has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from his\\r\\nfood in which appetite had no share? I have been thrilled to think that\\r\\nI owed a mental perception to the commonly gross sense of taste, that I\\r\\nhave been inspired through the palate, that some berries which I had\\r\\neaten on a hill-side had fed my genius. “The soul not being mistress of\\r\\nherself,” says Thseng-tseu, “one looks, and one does not see; one\\r\\nlistens, and one does not hear; one eats, and one does not know the\\r\\nsavor of food.” He who distinguishes the true savor of his food can\\r\\nnever be a glutton; he who does not cannot be otherwise. A puritan may\\r\\ngo to his brown-bread crust with as gross an appetite as ever an\\r\\nalderman to his turtle. Not that food which entereth into the mouth\\r\\ndefileth a man, but the appetite with which it is eaten. It is neither\\r\\nthe quality nor the quantity, but the devotion to sensual savors; when\\r\\nthat which is eaten is not a viand to sustain our animal, or inspire\\r\\nour spiritual life, but food for the worms that possess us. If the\\r\\nhunter has a taste for mud-turtles, muskrats, and other such savage\\r\\ntid-bits, the fine lady indulges a taste for jelly made of a calf’s\\r\\nfoot, or for sardines from over the sea, and they are even. He goes to\\r\\nthe mill-pond, she to her preserve-pot. The wonder is how they, how you\\r\\nand I, can live this slimy, beastly life, eating and drinking.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur whole life is startlingly moral. There is never an instant’s truce\\r\\nbetween virtue and vice. Goodness is the only investment that never\\r\\nfails. In the music of the harp which trembles round the world it is\\r\\nthe insisting on this which thrills us. The harp is the travelling\\r\\npatterer for the Universe’s Insurance Company, recommending its laws,\\r\\nand our little goodness is all the assessment that we pay. Though the\\r\\nyouth at last grows indifferent, the laws of the universe are not\\r\\nindifferent, but are forever on the side of the most sensitive. Listen\\r\\nto every zephyr for some reproof, for it is surely there, and he is\\r\\nunfortunate who does not hear it. We cannot touch a string or move a\\r\\nstop but the charming moral transfixes us. Many an irksome noise, go a\\r\\nlong way off, is heard as music, a proud sweet satire on the meanness\\r\\nof our lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are conscious of an animal in us, which awakens in proportion as our\\r\\nhigher nature slumbers. It is reptile and sensual, and perhaps cannot\\r\\nbe wholly expelled; like the worms which, even in life and health,\\r\\noccupy our bodies. Possibly we may withdraw from it, but never change\\r\\nits nature. I fear that it may enjoy a certain health of its own; that\\r\\nwe may be well, yet not pure. The other day I picked up the lower jaw\\r\\nof a hog, with white and sound teeth and tusks, which suggested that\\r\\nthere was an animal health and vigor distinct from the spiritual. This\\r\\ncreature succeeded by other means than temperance and purity. “That in\\r\\nwhich men differ from brute beasts,” says Mencius, “is a thing very\\r\\ninconsiderable; the common herd lose it very soon; superior men\\r\\npreserve it carefully.” Who knows what sort of life would result if we\\r\\nhad attained to purity? If I knew so wise a man as could teach me\\r\\npurity I would go to seek him forthwith. “A command over our passions,\\r\\nand over the external senses of the body, and good acts, are declared\\r\\nby the Ved to be indispensable in the mind’s approximation to God.” Yet\\r\\nthe spirit can for the time pervade and control every member and\\r\\nfunction of the body, and transmute what in form is the grossest\\r\\nsensuality into purity and devotion. The generative energy, which, when\\r\\nwe are loose, dissipates and makes us unclean, when we are continent\\r\\ninvigorates and inspires us. Chastity is the flowering of man; and what\\r\\nare called Genius, Heroism, Holiness, and the like, are but various\\r\\nfruits which succeed it. Man flows at once to God when the channel of\\r\\npurity is open. By turns our purity inspires and our impurity casts us\\r\\ndown. He is blessed who is assured that the animal is dying out in him\\r\\nday by day, and the divine being established. Perhaps there is none but\\r\\nhas cause for shame on account of the inferior and brutish nature to\\r\\nwhich he is allied. I fear that we are such gods or demigods only as\\r\\nfauns and satyrs, the divine allied to beasts, the creatures of\\r\\nappetite, and that, to some extent, our very life is our disgrace.—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “How happy’s he who hath due place assigned\\r\\n     To his beasts and disafforested his mind!\\r\\n                *    *    *    *    *\\r\\n     Can use this horse, goat, wolf, and ev’ry beast,\\r\\n     And is not ass himself to all the rest!\\r\\n     Else man not only is the herd of swine,\\r\\n     But he’s those devils too which did incline\\r\\n     Them to a headlong rage, and made them worse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll sensuality is one, though it takes many forms; all purity is one.\\r\\nIt is the same whether a man eat, or drink, or cohabit, or sleep\\r\\nsensually. They are but one appetite, and we only need to see a person\\r\\ndo any one of these things to know how great a sensualist he is. The\\r\\nimpure can neither stand nor sit with purity. When the reptile is\\r\\nattacked at one mouth of his burrow, he shows himself at another. If\\r\\nyou would be chaste, you must be temperate. What is chastity? How shall\\r\\na man know if he is chaste? He shall not know it. We have heard of this\\r\\nvirtue, but we know not what it is. We speak conformably to the rumor\\r\\nwhich we have heard. From exertion come wisdom and purity; from sloth\\r\\nignorance and sensuality. In the student sensuality is a sluggish habit\\r\\nof mind. An unclean person is universally a slothful one, one who sits\\r\\nby a stove, whom the sun shines on prostrate, who reposes without being\\r\\nfatigued. If you would avoid uncleanness, and all the sins, work\\r\\nearnestly, though it be at cleaning a stable. Nature is hard to be\\r\\novercome, but she must be overcome. What avails it that you are\\r\\nChristian, if you are not purer than the heathen, if you deny yourself\\r\\nno more, if you are not more religious? I know of many systems of\\r\\nreligion esteemed heathenish whose precepts fill the reader with shame,\\r\\nand provoke him to new endeavors, though it be to the performance of\\r\\nrites merely.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hesitate to say these things, but it is not because of the subject,—I\\r\\ncare not how obscene my _words_ are,—but because I cannot speak of them\\r\\nwithout betraying my impurity. We discourse freely without shame of one\\r\\nform of sensuality, and are silent about another. We are so degraded\\r\\nthat we cannot speak simply of the necessary functions of human nature.\\r\\nIn earlier ages, in some countries, every function was reverently\\r\\nspoken of and regulated by law. Nothing was too trivial for the Hindoo\\r\\nlawgiver, however offensive it may be to modern taste. He teaches how\\r\\nto eat, drink, cohabit, void excrement and urine, and the like,\\r\\nelevating what is mean, and does not falsely excuse himself by calling\\r\\nthese things trifles.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery man is the builder of a temple, called his body, to the god he\\r\\nworships, after a style purely his own, nor can he get off by hammering\\r\\nmarble instead. We are all sculptors and painters, and our material is\\r\\nour own flesh and blood and bones. Any nobleness begins at once to\\r\\nrefine a man’s features, any meanness or sensuality to imbrute them.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Farmer sat at his door one September evening, after a hard day’s\\r\\nwork, his mind still running on his labor more or less. Having bathed,\\r\\nhe sat down to re-create his intellectual man. It was a rather cool\\r\\nevening, and some of his neighbors were apprehending a frost. He had\\r\\nnot attended to the train of his thoughts long when he heard some one\\r\\nplaying on a flute, and that sound harmonized with his mood. Still he\\r\\nthought of his work; but the burden of his thought was, that though\\r\\nthis kept running in his head, and he found himself planning and\\r\\ncontriving it against his will, yet it concerned him very little. It\\r\\nwas no more than the scurf of his skin, which was constantly shuffled\\r\\noff. But the notes of the flute came home to his ears out of a\\r\\ndifferent sphere from that he worked in, and suggested work for certain\\r\\nfaculties which slumbered in him. They gently did away with the street,\\r\\nand the village, and the state in which he lived. A voice said to\\r\\nhim,—Why do you stay here and live this mean moiling life, when a\\r\\nglorious existence is possible for you? Those same stars twinkle over\\r\\nother fields than these.—But how to come out of this condition and\\r\\nactually migrate thither? All that he could think of was to practise\\r\\nsome new austerity, to let his mind descend into his body and redeem\\r\\nit, and treat himself with ever increasing respect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrute Neighbors\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes I had a companion in my fishing, who came through the village\\r\\nto my house from the other side of the town, and the catching of the\\r\\ndinner was as much a social exercise as the eating of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Hermit._ I wonder what the world is doing now. I have not heard so\\r\\nmuch as a locust over the sweet-fern these three hours. The pigeons are\\r\\nall asleep upon their roosts,—no flutter from them. Was that a farmer’s\\r\\nnoon horn which sounded from beyond the woods just now? The hands are\\r\\ncoming in to boiled salt beef and cider and Indian bread. Why will men\\r\\nworry themselves so? He that does not eat need not work. I wonder how\\r\\nmuch they have reaped. Who would live there where a body can never\\r\\nthink for the barking of Bose? And O, the housekeeping! to keep bright\\r\\nthe devil’s door-knobs, and scour his tubs this bright day! Better not\\r\\nkeep a house. Say, some hollow tree; and then for morning calls and\\r\\ndinner-parties! Only a woodpecker tapping. O, they swarm; the sun is\\r\\ntoo warm there; they are born too far into life for me. I have water\\r\\nfrom the spring, and a loaf of brown bread on the shelf.—Hark! I hear a\\r\\nrustling of the leaves. Is it some ill-fed village hound yielding to\\r\\nthe instinct of the chase? or the lost pig which is said to be in these\\r\\nwoods, whose tracks I saw after the rain? It comes on apace; my sumachs\\r\\nand sweet-briers tremble.—Eh, Mr. Poet, is it you? How do you like the\\r\\nworld to-day?\\r\\n\\r\\n_Poet._ See those clouds; how they hang! That’s the greatest thing I\\r\\nhave seen to-day. There’s nothing like it in old paintings, nothing\\r\\nlike it in foreign lands,—unless when we were off the coast of Spain.\\r\\nThat’s a true Mediterranean sky. I thought, as I have my living to get,\\r\\nand have not eaten to-day, that I might go a-fishing. That’s the true\\r\\nindustry for poets. It is the only trade I have learned. Come, let’s\\r\\nalong.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Hermit._ I cannot resist. My brown bread will soon be gone. I will go\\r\\nwith you gladly soon, but I am just concluding a serious meditation. I\\r\\nthink that I am near the end of it. Leave me alone, then, for a while.\\r\\nBut that we may not be delayed, you shall be digging the bait\\r\\nmeanwhile. Angle-worms are rarely to be met with in these parts, where\\r\\nthe soil was never fattened with manure; the race is nearly extinct.\\r\\nThe sport of digging the bait is nearly equal to that of catching the\\r\\nfish, when one’s appetite is not too keen; and this you may have all to\\r\\nyourself to-day. I would advise you to set in the spade down yonder\\r\\namong the ground-nuts, where you see the johnswort waving. I think that\\r\\nI may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up, if you look\\r\\nwell in among the roots of the grass, as if you were weeding. Or, if\\r\\nyou choose to go farther, it will not be unwise, for I have found the\\r\\nincrease of fair bait to be very nearly as the squares of the\\r\\ndistances.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Hermit alone._ Let me see; where was I? Methinks I was nearly in this\\r\\nframe of mind; the world lay about at this angle. Shall I go to heaven\\r\\nor a-fishing? If I should soon bring this meditation to an end, would\\r\\nanother so sweet occasion be likely to offer? I was as near being\\r\\nresolved into the essence of things as ever I was in my life. I fear my\\r\\nthoughts will not come back to me. If it would do any good, I would\\r\\nwhistle for them. When they make us an offer, is it wise to say, We\\r\\nwill think of it? My thoughts have left no track, and I cannot find the\\r\\npath again. What was it that I was thinking of? It was a very hazy day.\\r\\nI will just try these three sentences of Con-fut-see; they may fetch\\r\\nthat state about again. I know not whether it was the dumps or a\\r\\nbudding ecstasy. Mem. There never is but one opportunity of a kind.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Poet._ How now, Hermit, is it too soon? I have got just thirteen whole\\r\\nones, beside several which are imperfect or undersized; but they will\\r\\ndo for the smaller fry; they do not cover up the hook so much. Those\\r\\nvillage worms are quite too large; a shiner may make a meal off one\\r\\nwithout finding the skewer.\\r\\n\\r\\n_Hermit._ Well, then, let’s be off. Shall we to the Concord? There’s\\r\\ngood sport there if the water be not too high.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy do precisely these objects which we behold make a world? Why has\\r\\nman just these species of animals for his neighbors; as if nothing but\\r\\na mouse could have filled this crevice? I suspect that Pilpay & Co.\\r\\nhave put animals to their best use, for they are all beasts of burden,\\r\\nin a sense, made to carry some portion of our thoughts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mice which haunted my house were not the common ones, which are\\r\\nsaid to have been introduced into the country, but a wild native kind\\r\\nnot found in the village. I sent one to a distinguished naturalist, and\\r\\nit interested him much. When I was building, one of these had its nest\\r\\nunderneath the house, and before I had laid the second floor, and swept\\r\\nout the shavings, would come out regularly at lunch time and pick up\\r\\nthe crumbs at my feet. It probably had never seen a man before; and it\\r\\nsoon became quite familiar, and would run over my shoes and up my\\r\\nclothes. It could readily ascend the sides of the room by short\\r\\nimpulses, like a squirrel, which it resembled in its motions. At\\r\\nlength, as I leaned with my elbow on the bench one day, it ran up my\\r\\nclothes, and along my sleeve, and round and round the paper which held\\r\\nmy dinner, while I kept the latter close, and dodged and played at\\r\\nbopeep with it; and when at last I held still a piece of cheese between\\r\\nmy thumb and finger, it came and nibbled it, sitting in my hand, and\\r\\nafterward cleaned its face and paws, like a fly, and walked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nA phœbe soon built in my shed, and a robin for protection in a pine\\r\\nwhich grew against the house. In June the partridge (_Tetrao\\r\\numbellus_,) which is so shy a bird, led her brood past my windows, from\\r\\nthe woods in the rear to the front of my house, clucking and calling to\\r\\nthem like a hen, and in all her behavior proving herself the hen of the\\r\\nwoods. The young suddenly disperse on your approach, at a signal from\\r\\nthe mother, as if a whirlwind had swept them away, and they so exactly\\r\\nresemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has placed his\\r\\nfoot in the midst of a brood, and heard the whir of the old bird as she\\r\\nflew off, and her anxious calls and mewing, or seen her trail her wings\\r\\nto attract his attention, without suspecting their neighborhood. The\\r\\nparent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a\\r\\ndishabille, that you cannot, for a few moments, detect what kind of\\r\\ncreature it is. The young squat still and flat, often running their\\r\\nheads under a leaf, and mind only their mother’s directions given from\\r\\na distance, nor will your approach make them run again and betray\\r\\nthemselves. You may even tread on them, or have your eyes on them for a\\r\\nminute, without discovering them. I have held them in my open hand at\\r\\nsuch a time, and still their only care, obedient to their mother and\\r\\ntheir instinct, was to squat there without fear or trembling. So\\r\\nperfect is this instinct, that once, when I had laid them on the leaves\\r\\nagain, and one accidentally fell on its side, it was found with the\\r\\nrest in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward. They are not\\r\\ncallow like the young of most birds, but more perfectly developed and\\r\\nprecocious even than chickens. The remarkably adult yet innocent\\r\\nexpression of their open and serene eyes is very memorable. All\\r\\nintelligence seems reflected in them. They suggest not merely the\\r\\npurity of infancy, but a wisdom clarified by experience. Such an eye\\r\\nwas not born when the bird was, but is coeval with the sky it reflects.\\r\\nThe woods do not yield another such a gem. The traveller does not often\\r\\nlook into such a limpid well. The ignorant or reckless sportsman often\\r\\nshoots the parent at such a time, and leaves these innocents to fall a\\r\\nprey to some prowling beast or bird, or gradually mingle with the\\r\\ndecaying leaves which they so much resemble. It is said that when\\r\\nhatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some alarm, and so are\\r\\nlost, for they never hear the mother’s call which gathers them again.\\r\\nThese were my hens and chickens.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret in\\r\\nthe woods, and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns,\\r\\nsuspected by hunters only. How retired the otter manages to live here!\\r\\nHe grows to be four feet long, as big as a small boy, perhaps without\\r\\nany human being getting a glimpse of him. I formerly saw the raccoon in\\r\\nthe woods behind where my house is built, and probably still heard\\r\\ntheir whinnering at night. Commonly I rested an hour or two in the\\r\\nshade at noon, after planting, and ate my lunch, and read a little by a\\r\\nspring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook, oozing from\\r\\nunder Brister’s Hill, half a mile from my field. The approach to this\\r\\nwas through a succession of descending grassy hollows, full of young\\r\\npitch-pines, into a larger wood about the swamp. There, in a very\\r\\nsecluded and shaded spot, under a spreading white-pine, there was yet a\\r\\nclean, firm sward to sit on. I had dug out the spring and made a well\\r\\nof clear gray water, where I could dip up a pailful without roiling it,\\r\\nand thither I went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer, when\\r\\nthe pond was warmest. Thither, too, the wood-cock led her brood, to\\r\\nprobe the mud for worms, flying but a foot above them down the bank,\\r\\nwhile they ran in a troop beneath; but at last, spying me, she would\\r\\nleave her young and circle round and round me, nearer and nearer till\\r\\nwithin four or five feet, pretending broken wings and legs, to attract\\r\\nmy attention, and get off her young, who would already have taken up\\r\\ntheir march, with faint wiry peep, single file through the swamp, as\\r\\nshe directed. Or I heard the peep of the young when I could not see the\\r\\nparent bird. There too the turtle-doves sat over the spring, or\\r\\nfluttered from bough to bough of the soft white-pines over my head; or\\r\\nthe red squirrel, coursing down the nearest bough, was particularly\\r\\nfamiliar and inquisitive. You only need sit still long enough in some\\r\\nattractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit\\r\\nthemselves to you by turns.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was witness to events of a less peaceful character. One day when I\\r\\nwent out to my wood-pile, or rather my pile of stumps, I observed two\\r\\nlarge ants, the one red, the other much larger, nearly half an inch\\r\\nlong, and black, fiercely contending with one another. Having once got\\r\\nhold they never let go, but struggled and wrestled and rolled on the\\r\\nchips incessantly. Looking farther, I was surprised to find that the\\r\\nchips were covered with such combatants, that it was not a _duellum_,\\r\\nbut a _bellum_, a war between two races of ants, the red always pitted\\r\\nagainst the black, and frequently two red ones to one black. The\\r\\nlegions of these Myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my\\r\\nwood-yard, and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying,\\r\\nboth red and black. It was the only battle which I have ever witnessed,\\r\\nthe only battle-field I ever trod while the battle was raging;\\r\\ninternecine war; the red republicans on the one hand, and the black\\r\\nimperialists on the other. On every side they were engaged in deadly\\r\\ncombat, yet without any noise that I could hear, and human soldiers\\r\\nnever fought so resolutely. I watched a couple that were fast locked in\\r\\neach other’s embraces, in a little sunny valley amid the chips, now at\\r\\nnoon-day prepared to fight till the sun went down, or life went out.\\r\\nThe smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his\\r\\nadversary’s front, and through all the tumblings on that field never\\r\\nfor an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root,\\r\\nhaving already caused the other to go by the board; while the stronger\\r\\nblack one dashed him from side to side, and, as I saw on looking\\r\\nnearer, had already divested him of several of his members. They fought\\r\\nwith more pertinacity than bull-dogs. Neither manifested the least\\r\\ndisposition to retreat. It was evident that their battle-cry was\\r\\nConquer or die. In the mean while there came along a single red ant on\\r\\nthe hill-side of this valley, evidently full of excitement, who either\\r\\nhad despatched his foe, or had not yet taken part in the battle;\\r\\nprobably the latter, for he had lost none of his limbs; whose mother\\r\\nhad charged him to return with his shield or upon it. Or perchance he\\r\\nwas some Achilles, who had nourished his wrath apart, and had now come\\r\\nto avenge or rescue his Patroclus. He saw this unequal combat from\\r\\nafar,—for the blacks were nearly twice the size of the red,—he drew\\r\\nnear with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of\\r\\nthe combatants; then, watching his opportunity, he sprang upon the\\r\\nblack warrior, and commenced his operations near the root of his right\\r\\nfore-leg, leaving the foe to select among his own members; and so there\\r\\nwere three united for life, as if a new kind of attraction had been\\r\\ninvented which put all other locks and cements to shame. I should not\\r\\nhave wondered by this time to find that they had their respective\\r\\nmusical bands stationed on some eminent chip, and playing their\\r\\nnational airs the while, to excite the slow and cheer the dying\\r\\ncombatants. I was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men.\\r\\nThe more you think of it, the less the difference. And certainly there\\r\\nis not the fight recorded in Concord history, at least, if in the\\r\\nhistory of America, that will bear a moment’s comparison with this,\\r\\nwhether for the numbers engaged in it, or for the patriotism and\\r\\nheroism displayed. For numbers and for carnage it was an Austerlitz or\\r\\nDresden. Concord Fight! Two killed on the patriots’ side, and Luther\\r\\nBlanchard wounded! Why here every ant was a Buttrick,—“Fire! for God’s\\r\\nsake fire!”—and thousands shared the fate of Davis and Hosmer. There\\r\\nwas not one hireling there. I have no doubt that it was a principle\\r\\nthey fought for, as much as our ancestors, and not to avoid a\\r\\nthree-penny tax on their tea; and the results of this battle will be as\\r\\nimportant and memorable to those whom it concerns as those of the\\r\\nbattle of Bunker Hill, at least.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took up the chip on which the three I have particularly described\\r\\nwere struggling, carried it into my house, and placed it under a\\r\\ntumbler on my window-sill, in order to see the issue. Holding a\\r\\nmicroscope to the first-mentioned red ant, I saw that, though he was\\r\\nassiduously gnawing at the near fore-leg of his enemy, having severed\\r\\nhis remaining feeler, his own breast was all torn away, exposing what\\r\\nvitals he had there to the jaws of the black warrior, whose breastplate\\r\\nwas apparently too thick for him to pierce; and the dark carbuncles of\\r\\nthe sufferer’s eyes shone with ferocity such as war only could excite.\\r\\nThey struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler, and when I looked\\r\\nagain the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from their\\r\\nbodies, and the still living heads were hanging on either side of him\\r\\nlike ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow, still apparently as firmly\\r\\nfastened as ever, and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles, being\\r\\nwithout feelers and with only the remnant of a leg, and I know not how\\r\\nmany other wounds, to divest himself of them; which at length, after\\r\\nhalf an hour more, he accomplished. I raised the glass, and he went off\\r\\nover the window-sill in that crippled state. Whether he finally\\r\\nsurvived that combat, and spent the remainder of his days in some Hotel\\r\\ndes Invalides, I do not know; but I thought that his industry would not\\r\\nbe worth much thereafter. I never learned which party was victorious,\\r\\nnor the cause of the war; but I felt for the rest of that day as if I\\r\\nhad had my feelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle,\\r\\nthe ferocity and carnage, of a human battle before my door.\\r\\n\\r\\nKirby and Spence tell us that the battles of ants have long been\\r\\ncelebrated and the date of them recorded, though they say that Huber is\\r\\nthe only modern author who appears to have witnessed them. “Æneas\\r\\nSylvius,” say they, “after giving a very circumstantial account of one\\r\\ncontested with great obstinacy by a great and small species on the\\r\\ntrunk of a pear tree,” adds that “‘This action was fought in the\\r\\npontificate of Eugenius the Fourth, in the presence of Nicholas\\r\\nPistoriensis, an eminent lawyer, who related the whole history of the\\r\\nbattle with the greatest fidelity.’ A similar engagement between great\\r\\nand small ants is recorded by Olaus Magnus, in which the small ones,\\r\\nbeing victorious, are said to have buried the bodies of their own\\r\\nsoldiers, but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds.\\r\\nThis event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant Christiern\\r\\nthe Second from Sweden.” The battle which I witnessed took place in the\\r\\nPresidency of Polk, five years before the passage of Webster’s\\r\\nFugitive-Slave Bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a village Bose, fit only to course a mud-turtle in a victualling\\r\\ncellar, sported his heavy quarters in the woods, without the knowledge\\r\\nof his master, and ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows and\\r\\nwoodchucks’ holes; led perchance by some slight cur which nimbly\\r\\nthreaded the wood, and might still inspire a natural terror in its\\r\\ndenizens;—now far behind his guide, barking like a canine bull toward\\r\\nsome small squirrel which had treed itself for scrutiny, then,\\r\\ncantering off, bending the bushes with his weight, imagining that he is\\r\\non the track of some stray member of the jerbilla family. Once I was\\r\\nsurprised to see a cat walking along the stony shore of the pond, for\\r\\nthey rarely wander so far from home. The surprise was mutual.\\r\\nNevertheless the most domestic cat, which has lain on a rug all her\\r\\ndays, appears quite at home in the woods, and, by her sly and stealthy\\r\\nbehavior, proves herself more native there than the regular\\r\\ninhabitants. Once, when berrying, I met with a cat with young kittens\\r\\nin the woods, quite wild, and they all, like their mother, had their\\r\\nbacks up and were fiercely spitting at me. A few years before I lived\\r\\nin the woods there was what was called a “winged cat” in one of the\\r\\nfarm-houses in Lincoln nearest the pond, Mr. Gilian Baker’s. When I\\r\\ncalled to see her in June, 1842, she was gone a-hunting in the woods,\\r\\nas was her wont, (I am not sure whether it was a male or female, and so\\r\\nuse the more common pronoun,) but her mistress told me that she came\\r\\ninto the neighborhood a little more than a year before, in April, and\\r\\nwas finally taken into their house; that she was of a dark\\r\\nbrownish-gray color, with a white spot on her throat, and white feet,\\r\\nand had a large bushy tail like a fox; that in the winter the fur grew\\r\\nthick and flatted out along her sides, forming stripes ten or twelve\\r\\ninches long by two and a half wide, and under her chin like a muff, the\\r\\nupper side loose, the under matted like felt, and in the spring these\\r\\nappendages dropped off. They gave me a pair of her “wings,” which I\\r\\nkeep still. There is no appearance of a membrane about them. Some\\r\\nthought it was part flying-squirrel or some other wild animal, which is\\r\\nnot impossible, for, according to naturalists, prolific hybrids have\\r\\nbeen produced by the union of the marten and domestic cat. This would\\r\\nhave been the right kind of cat for me to keep, if I had kept any; for\\r\\nwhy should not a poet’s cat be winged as well as his horse?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the fall the loon (_Colymbus glacialis_) came, as usual, to moult\\r\\nand bathe in the pond, making the woods ring with his wild laughter\\r\\nbefore I had risen. At rumor of his arrival all the Mill-dam sportsmen\\r\\nare on the alert, in gigs and on foot, two by two and three by three,\\r\\nwith patent rifles and conical balls and spy-glasses. They come\\r\\nrustling through the woods like autumn leaves, at least ten men to one\\r\\nloon. Some station themselves on this side of the pond, some on that,\\r\\nfor the poor bird cannot be omnipresent; if he dive here he must come\\r\\nup there. But now the kind October wind rises, rustling the leaves and\\r\\nrippling the surface of the water, so that no loon can be heard or\\r\\nseen, though his foes sweep the pond with spy-glasses, and make the\\r\\nwoods resound with their discharges. The waves generously rise and dash\\r\\nangrily, taking sides with all water-fowl, and our sportsmen must beat\\r\\na retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs. But they were too often\\r\\nsuccessful. When I went to get a pail of water early in the morning I\\r\\nfrequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few\\r\\nrods. If I endeavored to overtake him in a boat, in order to see how he\\r\\nwould manœuvre, he would dive and be completely lost, so that I did not\\r\\ndiscover him again, sometimes, till the latter part of the day. But I\\r\\nwas more than a match for him on the surface. He commonly went off in a\\r\\nrain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was paddling along the north shore one very calm October\\r\\nafternoon, for such days especially they settle on to the lakes, like\\r\\nthe milkweed down, having looked in vain over the pond for a loon,\\r\\nsuddenly one, sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods\\r\\nin front of me, set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself. I pursued\\r\\nwith a paddle and he dived, but when he came up I was nearer than\\r\\nbefore. He dived again, but I miscalculated the direction he would\\r\\ntake, and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this\\r\\ntime, for I had helped to widen the interval; and again he laughed long\\r\\nand loud, and with more reason than before. He manœuvred so cunningly\\r\\nthat I could not get within half a dozen rods of him. Each time, when\\r\\nhe came to the surface, turning his head this way and that, he cooly\\r\\nsurveyed the water and the land, and apparently chose his course so\\r\\nthat he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water and\\r\\nat the greatest distance from the boat. It was surprising how quickly\\r\\nhe made up his mind and put his resolve into execution. He led me at\\r\\nonce to the widest part of the pond, and could not be driven from it.\\r\\nWhile he was thinking one thing in his brain, I was endeavoring to\\r\\ndivine his thought in mine. It was a pretty game, played on the smooth\\r\\nsurface of the pond, a man against a loon. Suddenly your adversary’s\\r\\nchecker disappears beneath the board, and the problem is to place yours\\r\\nnearest to where his will appear again. Sometimes he would come up\\r\\nunexpectedly on the opposite side of me, having apparently passed\\r\\ndirectly under the boat. So long-winded was he and so unweariable, that\\r\\nwhen he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge again,\\r\\nnevertheless; and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond,\\r\\nbeneath the smooth surface, he might be speeding his way like a fish,\\r\\nfor he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its\\r\\ndeepest part. It is said that loons have been caught in the New York\\r\\nlakes eighty feet beneath the surface, with hooks set for trout,—though\\r\\nWalden is deeper than that. How surprised must the fishes be to see\\r\\nthis ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their\\r\\nschools! Yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on\\r\\nthe surface, and swam much faster there. Once or twice I saw a ripple\\r\\nwhere he approached the surface, just put his head out to reconnoitre,\\r\\nand instantly dived again. I found that it was as well for me to rest\\r\\non my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where\\r\\nhe would rise; for again and again, when I was straining my eyes over\\r\\nthe surface one way, I would suddenly be startled by his unearthly\\r\\nlaugh behind me. But why, after displaying so much cunning, did he\\r\\ninvariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh? Did\\r\\nnot his white breast enough betray him? He was indeed a silly loon, I\\r\\nthought. I could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up,\\r\\nand so also detected him. But after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever,\\r\\ndived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first. It was\\r\\nsurprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when\\r\\nhe came to the surface, doing all the work with his webbed feet\\r\\nbeneath. His usual note was this demoniac laughter, yet somewhat like\\r\\nthat of a water-fowl; but occasionally, when he had balked me most\\r\\nsuccessfully and come up a long way off, he uttered a long-drawn\\r\\nunearthly howl, probably more like that of a wolf than any bird; as\\r\\nwhen a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls. This\\r\\nwas his looning,—perhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here,\\r\\nmaking the woods ring far and wide. I concluded that he laughed in\\r\\nderision of my efforts, confident of his own resources. Though the sky\\r\\nwas by this time overcast, the pond was so smooth that I could see\\r\\nwhere he broke the surface when I did not hear him. His white breast,\\r\\nthe stillness of the air, and the smoothness of the water were all\\r\\nagainst him. At length, having come up fifty rods off, he uttered one\\r\\nof those prolonged howls, as if calling on the god of loons to aid him,\\r\\nand immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled the\\r\\nsurface, and filled the whole air with misty rain, and I was impressed\\r\\nas if it were the prayer of the loon answered, and his god was angry\\r\\nwith me; and so I left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous\\r\\nsurface.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor hours, in fall days, I watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer\\r\\nand hold the middle of the pond, far from the sportsman; tricks which\\r\\nthey will have less need to practise in Louisiana bayous. When\\r\\ncompelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over\\r\\nthe pond at a considerable height, from which they could easily see to\\r\\nother ponds and the river, like black motes in the sky; and, when I\\r\\nthought they had gone off thither long since, they would settle down by\\r\\na slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was\\r\\nleft free; but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of\\r\\nWalden I do not know, unless they love its water for the same reason\\r\\nthat I do.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse-Warming\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October I went a-graping to the river meadows, and loaded myself\\r\\nwith clusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for\\r\\nfood. There too I admired, though I did not gather, the cranberries,\\r\\nsmall waxen gems, pendants of the meadow grass, pearly and red, which\\r\\nthe farmer plucks with an ugly rake, leaving the smooth meadow in a\\r\\nsnarl, heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only, and\\r\\nsells the spoils of the meads to Boston and New York; destined to be\\r\\n_jammed_, to satisfy the tastes of lovers of Nature there. So butchers\\r\\nrake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass, regardless of the\\r\\ntorn and drooping plant. The barberry’s brilliant fruit was likewise\\r\\nfood for my eyes merely; but I collected a small store of wild apples\\r\\nfor coddling, which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked. When\\r\\nchestnuts were ripe I laid up half a bushel for winter. It was very\\r\\nexciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of\\r\\nLincoln,—they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad,—with a bag\\r\\non my shoulder, and a stick to open burrs with in my hand, for I did\\r\\nnot always wait for the frost, amid the rustling of leaves and the loud\\r\\nreproofs of the red-squirrels and the jays, whose half-consumed nuts I\\r\\nsometimes stole, for the burrs which they had selected were sure to\\r\\ncontain sound ones. Occasionally I climbed and shook the trees. They\\r\\ngrew also behind my house, and one large tree, which almost\\r\\novershadowed it, was, when in flower, a bouquet which scented the whole\\r\\nneighborhood, but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit; the\\r\\nlast coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of\\r\\nthe burrs before they fell. I relinquished these trees to them and\\r\\nvisited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut. These nuts,\\r\\nas far as they went, were a good substitute for bread. Many other\\r\\nsubstitutes might, perhaps, be found. Digging one day for fish-worms, I\\r\\ndiscovered the ground-nut (_Apios tuberosa_) on its string, the potato\\r\\nof the aborigines, a sort of fabulous fruit, which I had begun to doubt\\r\\nif I had ever dug and eaten in childhood, as I had told, and had not\\r\\ndreamed it. I had often since seen its crimpled red velvety blossom\\r\\nsupported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the\\r\\nsame. Cultivation has well nigh exterminated it. It has a sweetish\\r\\ntaste, much like that of a frostbitten potato, and I found it better\\r\\nboiled than roasted. This tuber seemed like a faint promise of Nature\\r\\nto rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future\\r\\nperiod. In these days of fatted cattle and waving grain-fields this\\r\\nhumble root, which was once the _totem_ of an Indian tribe, is quite\\r\\nforgotten, or known only by its flowering vine; but let wild Nature\\r\\nreign here once more, and the tender and luxurious English grains will\\r\\nprobably disappear before a myriad of foes, and without the care of man\\r\\nthe crow may carry back even the last seed of corn to the great\\r\\ncornfield of the Indian’s God in the south-west, whence he is said to\\r\\nhave brought it; but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will\\r\\nperhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness, prove\\r\\nitself indigenous, and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the\\r\\ndiet of the hunter tribe. Some Indian Ceres or Minerva must have been\\r\\nthe inventor and bestower of it; and when the reign of poetry commences\\r\\nhere, its leaves and string of nuts may be represented on our works of\\r\\nart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready, by the first of September, I had seen two or three small\\r\\nmaples turned scarlet across the pond, beneath where the white stems of\\r\\nthree aspens diverged, at the point of a promontory, next the water.\\r\\nAh, many a tale their color told! And gradually from week to week the\\r\\ncharacter of each tree came out, and it admired itself reflected in the\\r\\nsmooth mirror of the lake. Each morning the manager of this gallery\\r\\nsubstituted some new picture, distinguished by more brilliant or\\r\\nharmonious coloring, for the old upon the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wasps came by thousands to my lodge in October, as to winter\\r\\nquarters, and settled on my windows within and on the walls over-head,\\r\\nsometimes deterring visitors from entering. Each morning, when they\\r\\nwere numbed with cold, I swept some of them out, but I did not trouble\\r\\nmyself much to get rid of them; I even felt complimented by their\\r\\nregarding my house as a desirable shelter. They never molested me\\r\\nseriously, though they bedded with me; and they gradually disappeared,\\r\\ninto what crevices I do not know, avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the wasps, before I finally went into winter quarters in November,\\r\\nI used to resort to the north-east side of Walden, which the sun,\\r\\nreflected from the pitch-pine woods and the stony shore, made the\\r\\nfire-side of the pond; it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to be\\r\\nwarmed by the sun while you can be, than by an artificial fire. I thus\\r\\nwarmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer, like a\\r\\ndeparted hunter, had left.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came to build my chimney I studied masonry. My bricks being\\r\\nsecond-hand ones required to be cleaned with a trowel, so that I\\r\\nlearned more than usual of the qualities of bricks and trowels. The\\r\\nmortar on them was fifty years old, and was said to be still growing\\r\\nharder; but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeat\\r\\nwhether they are true or not. Such sayings themselves grow harder and\\r\\nadhere more firmly with age, and it would take many blows with a trowel\\r\\nto clean an old wiseacre of them. Many of the villages of Mesopotamia\\r\\nare built of second-hand bricks of a very good quality, obtained from\\r\\nthe ruins of Babylon, and the cement on them is older and probably\\r\\nharder still. However that may be, I was struck by the peculiar\\r\\ntoughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without being\\r\\nworn out. As my bricks had been in a chimney before, though I did not\\r\\nread the name of Nebuchadnezzar on them, I picked out as many\\r\\nfire-place bricks as I could find, to save work and waste, and I filled\\r\\nthe spaces between the bricks about the fire-place with stones from the\\r\\npond shore, and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same\\r\\nplace. I lingered most about the fireplace, as the most vital part of\\r\\nthe house. Indeed, I worked so deliberately, that though I commenced at\\r\\nthe ground in the morning, a course of bricks raised a few inches above\\r\\nthe floor served for my pillow at night; yet I did not get a stiff neck\\r\\nfor it that I remember; my stiff neck is of older date. I took a poet\\r\\nto board for a fortnight about those times, which caused me to be put\\r\\nto it for room. He brought his own knife, though I had two, and we used\\r\\nto scour them by thrusting them into the earth. He shared with me the\\r\\nlabors of cooking. I was pleased to see my work rising so square and\\r\\nsolid by degrees, and reflected, that, if it proceeded slowly, it was\\r\\ncalculated to endure a long time. The chimney is to some extent an\\r\\nindependent structure, standing on the ground and rising through the\\r\\nhouse to the heavens; even after the house is burned it still stands\\r\\nsometimes, and its importance and independence are apparent. This was\\r\\ntoward the end of summer. It was now November.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe north wind had already begun to cool the pond, though it took many\\r\\nweeks of steady blowing to accomplish it, it is so deep. When I began\\r\\nto have a fire at evening, before I plastered my house, the chimney\\r\\ncarried smoke particularly well, because of the numerous chinks between\\r\\nthe boards. Yet I passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy\\r\\napartment, surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots, and\\r\\nrafters with the bark on high overhead. My house never pleased my eye\\r\\nso much after it was plastered, though I was obliged to confess that it\\r\\nwas more comfortable. Should not every apartment in which man dwells be\\r\\nlofty enough to create some obscurity over-head, where flickering\\r\\nshadows may play at evening about the rafters? These forms are more\\r\\nagreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other\\r\\nthe most expensive furniture. I now first began to inhabit my house, I\\r\\nmay say, when I began to use it for warmth as well as shelter. I had\\r\\ngot a couple of old fire-dogs to keep the wood from the hearth, and it\\r\\ndid me good to see the soot form on the back of the chimney which I had\\r\\nbuilt, and I poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than\\r\\nusual. My dwelling was small, and I could hardly entertain an echo in\\r\\nit; but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from\\r\\nneighbors. All the attractions of a house were concentrated in one\\r\\nroom; it was kitchen, chamber, parlor, and keeping-room; and whatever\\r\\nsatisfaction parent or child, master or servant, derive from living in\\r\\na house, I enjoyed it all. Cato says, the master of a family\\r\\n(_patremfamilias_) must have in his rustic villa “cellam oleariam,\\r\\nvinariam, dolia multa, uti lubeat caritatem expectare, et rei, et\\r\\nvirtuti, et gloriæ erit,” that is, “an oil and wine cellar, many casks,\\r\\nso that it may be pleasant to expect hard times; it will be for his\\r\\nadvantage, and virtue, and glory.” I had in my cellar a firkin of\\r\\npotatoes, about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them, and on my\\r\\nshelf a little rice, a jug of molasses, and of rye and Indian meal a\\r\\npeck each.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house, standing in a\\r\\ngolden age, of enduring materials, and without ginger-bread work, which\\r\\nshall still consist of only one room, a vast, rude, substantial,\\r\\nprimitive hall, without ceiling or plastering, with bare rafters and\\r\\npurlins supporting a sort of lower heaven over one’s head,—useful to\\r\\nkeep off rain and snow; where the king and queen posts stand out to\\r\\nreceive your homage, when you have done reverence to the prostrate\\r\\nSaturn of an older dynasty on stepping over the sill; a cavernous\\r\\nhouse, wherein you must reach up a torch upon a pole to see the roof;\\r\\nwhere some may live in the fire-place, some in the recess of a window,\\r\\nand some on settles, some at one end of the hall, some at another, and\\r\\nsome aloft on rafters with the spiders, if they choose; a house which\\r\\nyou have got into when you have opened the outside door, and the\\r\\nceremony is over; where the weary traveller may wash, and eat, and\\r\\nconverse, and sleep, without further journey; such a shelter as you\\r\\nwould be glad to reach in a tempestuous night, containing all the\\r\\nessentials of a house, and nothing for house-keeping; where you can see\\r\\nall the treasures of the house at one view, and every thing hangs upon\\r\\nits peg, that a man should use; at once kitchen, pantry, parlor,\\r\\nchamber, store-house, and garret; where you can see so necessary a\\r\\nthing as a barrel or a ladder, so convenient a thing as a cupboard, and\\r\\nhear the pot boil, and pay your respects to the fire that cooks your\\r\\ndinner and the oven that bakes your bread, and the necessary furniture\\r\\nand utensils are the chief ornaments; where the washing is not put out,\\r\\nnor the fire, nor the mistress, and perhaps you are sometimes requested\\r\\nto move from off the trap-door, when the cook would descend into the\\r\\ncellar, and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath you\\r\\nwithout stamping. A house whose inside is as open and manifest as a\\r\\nbird’s nest, and you cannot go in at the front door and out at the back\\r\\nwithout seeing some of its inhabitants; where to be a guest is to be\\r\\npresented with the freedom of the house, and not to be carefully\\r\\nexcluded from seven eighths of it, shut up in a particular cell, and\\r\\ntold to make yourself at home there,—in solitary confinement. Nowadays\\r\\nthe host does not admit you to _his_ hearth, but has got the mason to\\r\\nbuild one for yourself somewhere in his alley, and hospitality is the\\r\\nart of _keeping_ you at the greatest distance. There is as much secrecy\\r\\nabout the cooking as if he had a design to poison you. I am aware that\\r\\nI have been on many a man’s premises, and might have been legally\\r\\nordered off, but I am not aware that I have been in many men’s houses.\\r\\nI might visit in my old clothes a king and queen who lived simply in\\r\\nsuch a house as I have described, if I were going their way; but\\r\\nbacking out of a modern palace will be all that I shall desire to\\r\\nlearn, if ever I am caught in one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its\\r\\nnerve and degenerate into _palaver_ wholly, our lives pass at such\\r\\nremoteness from its symbols, and its metaphors and tropes are\\r\\nnecessarily so far fetched, through slides and dumb-waiters, as it\\r\\nwere; in other words, the parlor is so far from the kitchen and\\r\\nworkshop. The dinner even is only the parable of a dinner, commonly. As\\r\\nif only the savage dwelt near enough to Nature and Truth to borrow a\\r\\ntrope from them. How can the scholar, who dwells away in the North West\\r\\nTerritory or the Isle of Man, tell what is parliamentary in the\\r\\nkitchen?\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay and\\r\\neat a hasty-pudding with me; but when they saw that crisis approaching\\r\\nthey beat a hasty retreat rather, as if it would shake the house to its\\r\\nfoundations. Nevertheless, it stood through a great many\\r\\nhasty-puddings.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not plaster till it was freezing weather. I brought over some\\r\\nwhiter and cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the\\r\\npond in a boat, a sort of conveyance which would have tempted me to go\\r\\nmuch farther if necessary. My house had in the mean while been shingled\\r\\ndown to the ground on every side. In lathing I was pleased to be able\\r\\nto send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer, and it was my\\r\\nambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and\\r\\nrapidly. I remembered the story of a conceited fellow, who, in fine\\r\\nclothes, was wont to lounge about the village once, giving advice to\\r\\nworkmen. Venturing one day to substitute deeds for words, he turned up\\r\\nhis cuffs, seized a plasterer’s board, and having loaded his trowel\\r\\nwithout mishap, with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead,\\r\\nmade a bold gesture thitherward; and straightway, to his complete\\r\\ndiscomfiture, received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom. I\\r\\nadmired anew the economy and convenience of plastering, which so\\r\\neffectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish, and I\\r\\nlearned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable. I was\\r\\nsurprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the\\r\\nmoisture in my plaster before I had smoothed it, and how many pailfuls\\r\\nof water it takes to christen a new hearth. I had the previous winter\\r\\nmade a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the _Unio\\r\\nfluviatilis_, which our river affords, for the sake of the experiment;\\r\\nso that I knew where my materials came from. I might have got good\\r\\nlimestone within a mile or two and burned it myself, if I had cared to\\r\\ndo so.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pond had in the mean while skimmed over in the shadiest and\\r\\nshallowest coves, some days or even weeks before the general freezing.\\r\\nThe first ice is especially interesting and perfect, being hard, dark,\\r\\nand transparent, and affords the best opportunity that ever offers for\\r\\nexamining the bottom where it is shallow; for you can lie at your\\r\\nlength on ice only an inch thick, like a skater insect on the surface\\r\\nof the water, and study the bottom at your leisure, only two or three\\r\\ninches distant, like a picture behind a glass, and the water is\\r\\nnecessarily always smooth then. There are many furrows in the sand\\r\\nwhere some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks; and,\\r\\nfor wrecks, it is strewn with the cases of cadis worms made of minute\\r\\ngrains of white quartz. Perhaps these have creased it, for you find\\r\\nsome of their cases in the furrows, though they are deep and broad for\\r\\nthem to make. But the ice itself is the object of most interest, though\\r\\nyou must improve the earliest opportunity to study it. If you examine\\r\\nit closely the morning after it freezes, you find that the greater part\\r\\nof the bubbles, which at first appeared to be within it, are against\\r\\nits under surface, and that more are continually rising from the\\r\\nbottom; while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark, that is,\\r\\nyou see the water through it. These bubbles are from an eightieth to an\\r\\neighth of an inch in diameter, very clear and beautiful, and you see\\r\\nyour face reflected in them through the ice. There may be thirty or\\r\\nforty of them to a square inch. There are also already within the ice\\r\\nnarrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long, sharp\\r\\ncones with the apex upward; or oftener, if the ice is quite fresh,\\r\\nminute spherical bubbles one directly above another, like a string of\\r\\nbeads. But these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as\\r\\nthose beneath. I sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength\\r\\nof the ice, and those which broke through carried in air with them,\\r\\nwhich formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath. One day\\r\\nwhen I came to the same place forty-eight hours afterward, I found that\\r\\nthose large bubbles were still perfect, though an inch more of ice had\\r\\nformed, as I could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake.\\r\\nBut as the last two days had been very warm, like an Indian summer, the\\r\\nice was not now transparent, showing the dark green color of the water,\\r\\nand the bottom, but opaque and whitish or gray, and though twice as\\r\\nthick was hardly stronger than before, for the air bubbles had greatly\\r\\nexpanded under this heat and run together, and lost their regularity;\\r\\nthey were no longer one directly over another, but often like silvery\\r\\ncoins poured from a bag, one overlapping another, or in thin flakes, as\\r\\nif occupying slight cleavages. The beauty of the ice was gone, and it\\r\\nwas too late to study the bottom. Being curious to know what position\\r\\nmy great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice, I broke out a\\r\\ncake containing a middling sized one, and turned it bottom upward. The\\r\\nnew ice had formed around and under the bubble, so that it was included\\r\\nbetween the two ices. It was wholly in the lower ice, but close against\\r\\nthe upper, and was flattish, or perhaps slightly lenticular, with a\\r\\nrounded edge, a quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter; and\\r\\nI was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice was\\r\\nmelted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed, to the\\r\\nheight of five eighths of an inch in the middle, leaving a thin\\r\\npartition there between the water and the bubble, hardly an eighth of\\r\\nan inch thick; and in many places the small bubbles in this partition\\r\\nhad burst out downward, and probably there was no ice at all under the\\r\\nlargest bubbles, which were a foot in diameter. I inferred that the\\r\\ninfinite number of minute bubbles which I had first seen against the\\r\\nunder surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise, and that each, in\\r\\nits degree, had operated like a burning glass on the ice beneath to\\r\\nmelt and rot it. These are the little air-guns which contribute to make\\r\\nthe ice crack and whoop.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the winter set in in good earnest, just as I had finished\\r\\nplastering, and the wind began to howl around the house as if it had\\r\\nnot had permission to do so till then. Night after night the geese came\\r\\nlumbering in in the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings, even\\r\\nafter the ground was covered with snow, some to alight in Walden, and\\r\\nsome flying low over the woods toward Fair Haven, bound for Mexico.\\r\\nSeveral times, when returning from the village at ten or eleven o’clock\\r\\nat night, I heard the tread of a flock of geese, or else ducks, on the\\r\\ndry leaves in the woods by a pond-hole behind my dwelling, where they\\r\\nhad come up to feed, and the faint honk or quack of their leader as\\r\\nthey hurried off. In 1845 Walden froze entirely over for the first time\\r\\non the night of the 22d of December, Flint’s and other shallower ponds\\r\\nand the river having been frozen ten days or more; in ’46, the 16th; in\\r\\n’49, about the 31st; and in ’50, about the 27th of December; in ’52,\\r\\nthe 5th of January; in ’53, the 31st of December. The snow had already\\r\\ncovered the ground since the 25th of November, and surrounded me\\r\\nsuddenly with the scenery of winter. I withdrew yet farther into my\\r\\nshell, and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and\\r\\nwithin my breast. My employment out of doors now was to collect the\\r\\ndead wood in the forest, bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders, or\\r\\nsometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed. An old\\r\\nforest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me. I\\r\\nsacrificed it to Vulcan, for it was past serving the god Terminus. How\\r\\nmuch more interesting an event is that man’s supper who has just been\\r\\nforth in the snow to hunt, nay, you might say, steal, the fuel to cook\\r\\nit with! His bread and meat are sweet. There are enough fagots and\\r\\nwaste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to support\\r\\nmany fires, but which at present warm none, and, some think, hinder the\\r\\ngrowth of the young wood. There was also the drift-wood of the pond. In\\r\\nthe course of the summer I had discovered a raft of pitch-pine logs\\r\\nwith the bark on, pinned together by the Irish when the railroad was\\r\\nbuilt. This I hauled up partly on the shore. After soaking two years\\r\\nand then lying high six months it was perfectly sound, though\\r\\nwaterlogged past drying. I amused myself one winter day with sliding\\r\\nthis piecemeal across the pond, nearly half a mile, skating behind with\\r\\none end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder, and the other on the\\r\\nice; or I tied several logs together with a birch withe, and then, with\\r\\na longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end, dragged them\\r\\nacross. Though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead, they\\r\\nnot only burned long, but made a very hot fire; nay, I thought that\\r\\nthey burned better for the soaking, as if the pitch, being confined by\\r\\nthe water, burned longer, as in a lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nGilpin, in his account of the forest borderers of England, says that\\r\\n“the encroachments of trespassers, and the houses and fences thus\\r\\nraised on the borders of the forest,” were “considered as great\\r\\nnuisances by the old forest law, and were severely punished under the\\r\\nname of _purprestures_, as tending _ad terrorem ferarum—ad nocumentum\\r\\nforestæ_, &c.,” to the frightening of the game and the detriment of the\\r\\nforest. But I was interested in the preservation of the venison and the\\r\\nvert more than the hunters or woodchoppers, and as much as though I had\\r\\nbeen the Lord Warden himself; and if any part was burned, though I\\r\\nburned it myself by accident, I grieved with a grief that lasted longer\\r\\nand was more inconsolable than that of the proprietors; nay, I grieved\\r\\nwhen it was cut down by the proprietors themselves. I would that our\\r\\nfarmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which the old\\r\\nRomans did when they came to thin, or let in the light to, a\\r\\nconsecrated grove (_lucum conlucare_), that is, would believe that it\\r\\nis sacred to some god. The Roman made an expiatory offering, and\\r\\nprayed, Whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is sacred,\\r\\nbe propitious to me, my family, and children, &c.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age\\r\\nand in this new country, a value more permanent and universal than that\\r\\nof gold. After all our discoveries and inventions no man will go by a\\r\\npile of wood. It is as precious to us as it was to our Saxon and Norman\\r\\nancestors. If they made their bows of it, we make our gun-stocks of it.\\r\\nMichaux, more than thirty years ago, says that the price of wood for\\r\\nfuel in New York and Philadelphia “nearly equals, and sometimes\\r\\nexceeds, that of the best wood in Paris, though this immense capital\\r\\nannually requires more than three hundred thousand cords, and is\\r\\nsurrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by cultivated\\r\\nplains.” In this town the price of wood rises almost steadily, and the\\r\\nonly question is, how much higher it is to be this year than it was the\\r\\nlast. Mechanics and tradesmen who come in person to the forest on no\\r\\nother errand, are sure to attend the wood auction, and even pay a high\\r\\nprice for the privilege of gleaning after the woodchopper. It is now\\r\\nmany years that men have resorted to the forest for fuel and the\\r\\nmaterials of the arts; the New Englander and the New Hollander, the\\r\\nParisian and the Celt, the farmer and Robinhood, Goody Blake and Harry\\r\\nGill, in most parts of the world the prince and the peasant, the\\r\\nscholar and the savage, equally require still a few sticks from the\\r\\nforest to warm them and cook their food. Neither could I do without\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery man looks at his wood-pile with a kind of affection. I love to\\r\\nhave mine before my window, and the more chips the better to remind me\\r\\nof my pleasing work. I had an old axe which nobody claimed, with which\\r\\nby spells in winter days, on the sunny side of the house, I played\\r\\nabout the stumps which I had got out of my bean-field. As my driver\\r\\nprophesied when I was ploughing, they warmed me twice, once while I was\\r\\nsplitting them, and again when they were on the fire, so that no fuel\\r\\ncould give out more heat. As for the axe, I was advised to get the\\r\\nvillage blacksmith to “jump” it; but I jumped him, and, putting a\\r\\nhickory helve from the woods into it, made it do. If it was dull, it\\r\\nwas at least hung true.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure. It is interesting to\\r\\nremember how much of this food for fire is still concealed in the\\r\\nbowels of the earth. In previous years I had often gone “prospecting”\\r\\nover some bare hill-side, where a pitch-pine wood had formerly stood,\\r\\nand got out the fat pine roots. They are almost indestructible. Stumps\\r\\nthirty or forty years old, at least, will still be sound at the core,\\r\\nthough the sapwood has all become vegetable mould, as appears by the\\r\\nscales of the thick bark forming a ring level with the earth four or\\r\\nfive inches distant from the heart. With axe and shovel you explore\\r\\nthis mine, and follow the marrowy store, yellow as beef tallow, or as\\r\\nif you had struck on a vein of gold, deep into the earth. But commonly\\r\\nI kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest, which I had stored\\r\\nup in my shed before the snow came. Green hickory finely split makes\\r\\nthe woodchopper’s kindlings, when he has a camp in the woods. Once in a\\r\\nwhile I got a little of this. When the villagers were lighting their\\r\\nfires beyond the horizon, I too gave notice to the various wild\\r\\ninhabitants of Walden vale, by a smoky streamer from my chimney, that I\\r\\nwas awake.—\\r\\n\\r\\n     Light-winged Smoke, Icarian bird,\\r\\n     Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight,\\r\\n     Lark without song, and messenger of dawn,\\r\\n     Circling above the hamlets as thy nest;\\r\\n     Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form\\r\\n     Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts;\\r\\n     By night star-veiling, and by day\\r\\n     Darkening the light and blotting out the sun;\\r\\n     Go thou my incense upward from this hearth,\\r\\n     And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame.\\r\\n\\r\\nHard green wood just cut, though I used but little of that, answered my\\r\\npurpose better than any other. I sometimes left a good fire when I went\\r\\nto take a walk in a winter afternoon; and when I returned, three or\\r\\nfour hours afterward, it would be still alive and glowing. My house was\\r\\nnot empty though I was gone. It was as if I had left a cheerful\\r\\nhousekeeper behind. It was I and Fire that lived there; and commonly my\\r\\nhousekeeper proved trustworthy. One day, however, as I was splitting\\r\\nwood, I thought that I would just look in at the window and see if the\\r\\nhouse was not on fire; it was the only time I remember to have been\\r\\nparticularly anxious on this score; so I looked and saw that a spark\\r\\nhad caught my bed, and I went in and extinguished it when it had burned\\r\\na place as big as my hand. But my house occupied so sunny and sheltered\\r\\na position, and its roof was so low, that I could afford to let the\\r\\nfire go out in the middle of almost any winter day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moles nested in my cellar, nibbling every third potato, and making\\r\\na snug bed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown\\r\\npaper; for even the wildest animals love comfort and warmth as well as\\r\\nman, and they survive the winter only because they are so careful to\\r\\nsecure them. Some of my friends spoke as if I was coming to the woods\\r\\non purpose to freeze myself. The animal merely makes a bed, which he\\r\\nwarms with his body, in a sheltered place; but man, having discovered\\r\\nfire, boxes up some air in a spacious apartment, and warms that,\\r\\ninstead of robbing himself, makes that his bed, in which he can move\\r\\nabout divested of more cumbrous clothing, maintain a kind of summer in\\r\\nthe midst of winter, and by means of windows even admit the light, and\\r\\nwith a lamp lengthen out the day. Thus he goes a step or two beyond\\r\\ninstinct, and saves a little time for the fine arts. Though, when I had\\r\\nbeen exposed to the rudest blasts a long time, my whole body began to\\r\\ngrow torpid, when I reached the genial atmosphere of my house I soon\\r\\nrecovered my faculties and prolonged my life. But the most luxuriously\\r\\nhoused has little to boast of in this respect, nor need we trouble\\r\\nourselves to speculate how the human race may be at last destroyed. It\\r\\nwould be easy to cut their threads any time with a little sharper blast\\r\\nfrom the north. We go on dating from Cold Fridays and Great Snows; but\\r\\na little colder Friday, or greater snow, would put a period to man’s\\r\\nexistence on the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next winter I used a small cooking-stove for economy, since I did\\r\\nnot own the forest; but it did not keep fire so well as the open\\r\\nfire-place. Cooking was then, for the most part, no longer a poetic,\\r\\nbut merely a chemic process. It will soon be forgotten, in these days\\r\\nof stoves, that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes, after the\\r\\nIndian fashion. The stove not only took up room and scented the house,\\r\\nbut it concealed the fire, and I felt as if I had lost a companion. You\\r\\ncan always see a face in the fire. The laborer, looking into it at\\r\\nevening, purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they\\r\\nhave accumulated during the day. But I could no longer sit and look\\r\\ninto the fire, and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with\\r\\nnew force.—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Never, bright flame, may be denied to me\\r\\n     Thy dear, life imaging, close sympathy.\\r\\n     What but my hopes shot upward e’er so bright?\\r\\n     What but my fortunes sunk so low in night?\\r\\n\\r\\n     Why art thou banished from our hearth and hall,\\r\\n     Thou who art welcomed and beloved by all?\\r\\n     Was thy existence then too fanciful\\r\\n     For our life’s common light, who are so dull?\\r\\n     Did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold\\r\\n     With our congenial souls? secrets too bold?\\r\\n     Well, we are safe and strong, for now we sit\\r\\n     Beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit,\\r\\n     Where nothing cheers nor saddens, but a fire\\r\\n     Warms feet and hands—nor does to more aspire;\\r\\n     By whose compact utilitarian heap\\r\\n     The present may sit down and go to sleep,\\r\\n     Nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked,\\r\\n     And with us by the unequal light of the old wood fire talked.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer Inhabitants and Winter Visitors\\r\\n\\r\\nI weathered some merry snow storms, and spent some cheerful winter\\r\\nevenings by my fire-side, while the snow whirled wildly without, and\\r\\neven the hooting of the owl was hushed. For many weeks I met no one in\\r\\nmy walks but those who came occasionally to cut wood and sled it to the\\r\\nvillage. The elements, however, abetted me in making a path through the\\r\\ndeepest snow in the woods, for when I had once gone through the wind\\r\\nblew the oak leaves into my tracks, where they lodged, and by absorbing\\r\\nthe rays of the sun melted the snow, and so not only made a dry bed for\\r\\nmy feet, but in the night their dark line was my guide. For human\\r\\nsociety I was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of these\\r\\nwoods. Within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my\\r\\nhouse stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants, and\\r\\nthe woods which border it were notched and dotted here and there with\\r\\ntheir little gardens and dwellings, though it was then much more shut\\r\\nin by the forest than now. In some places, within my own remembrance,\\r\\nthe pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once, and women and\\r\\nchildren who were compelled to go this way to Lincoln alone and on foot\\r\\ndid it with fear, and often ran a good part of the distance. Though\\r\\nmainly but a humble route to neighboring villages, or for the woodman’s\\r\\nteam, it once amused the traveller more than now by its variety, and\\r\\nlingered longer in his memory. Where now firm open fields stretch from\\r\\nthe village to the woods, it then ran through a maple swamp on a\\r\\nfoundation of logs, the remnants of which, doubtless, still underlie\\r\\nthe present dusty highway, from the Stratton, now the Alms House, Farm,\\r\\nto Brister’s Hill.\\r\\n\\r\\nEast of my bean-field, across the road, lived Cato Ingraham, slave of\\r\\nDuncan Ingraham, Esquire, gentleman, of Concord village, who built his\\r\\nslave a house, and gave him permission to live in Walden Woods;—Cato,\\r\\nnot Uticensis, but Concordiensis. Some say that he was a Guinea Negro.\\r\\nThere are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts, which\\r\\nhe let grow up till he should be old and need them; but a younger and\\r\\nwhiter speculator got them at last. He too, however, occupies an\\r\\nequally narrow house at present. Cato’s half-obliterated cellar hole\\r\\nstill remains, though known to few, being concealed from the traveller\\r\\nby a fringe of pines. It is now filled with the smooth sumach (_Rhus\\r\\nglabra_,) and one of the earliest species of golden-rod (_Solidago\\r\\nstricta_) grows there luxuriantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, by the very corner of my field, still nearer to town, Zilpha, a\\r\\ncolored woman, had her little house, where she spun linen for the\\r\\ntownsfolk, making the Walden Woods ring with her shrill singing, for\\r\\nshe had a loud and notable voice. At length, in the war of 1812, her\\r\\ndwelling was set on fire by English soldiers, prisoners on parole, when\\r\\nshe was away, and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up together.\\r\\nShe led a hard life, and somewhat inhumane. One old frequenter of these\\r\\nwoods remembers, that as he passed her house one noon he heard her\\r\\nmuttering to herself over her gurgling pot,—“Ye are all bones, bones!”\\r\\nI have seen bricks amid the oak copse there.\\r\\n\\r\\nDown the road, on the right hand, on Brister’s Hill, lived Brister\\r\\nFreeman, “a handy Negro,” slave of Squire Cummings once,—there where\\r\\ngrow still the apple-trees which Brister planted and tended; large old\\r\\ntrees now, but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste. Not\\r\\nlong since I read his epitaph in the old Lincoln burying-ground, a\\r\\nlittle on one side, near the unmarked graves of some British grenadiers\\r\\nwho fell in the retreat from Concord,—where he is styled “Sippio\\r\\nBrister,”—Scipio Africanus he had some title to be called,—“a man of\\r\\ncolor,” as if he were discolored. It also told me, with staring\\r\\nemphasis, when he died; which was but an indirect way of informing me\\r\\nthat he ever lived. With him dwelt Fenda, his hospitable wife, who told\\r\\nfortunes, yet pleasantly,—large, round, and black, blacker than any of\\r\\nthe children of night, such a dusky orb as never rose on Concord before\\r\\nor since.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarther down the hill, on the left, on the old road in the woods, are\\r\\nmarks of some homestead of the Stratton family; whose orchard once\\r\\ncovered all the slope of Brister’s Hill, but was long since killed out\\r\\nby pitch pines, excepting a few stumps, whose old roots furnish still\\r\\nthe wild stocks of many a thrifty village tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nNearer yet to town, you come to Breed’s location, on the other side of\\r\\nthe way, just on the edge of the wood; ground famous for the pranks of\\r\\na demon not distinctly named in old mythology, who has acted a\\r\\nprominent and astounding part in our New England life, and deserves, as\\r\\nmuch as any mythological character, to have his biography written one\\r\\nday; who first comes in the guise of a friend or hired man, and then\\r\\nrobs and murders the whole family,—New-England Rum. But history must\\r\\nnot yet tell the tragedies enacted here; let time intervene in some\\r\\nmeasure to assuage and lend an azure tint to them. Here the most\\r\\nindistinct and dubious tradition says that once a tavern stood; the\\r\\nwell the same, which tempered the traveller’s beverage and refreshed\\r\\nhis steed. Here then men saluted one another, and heard and told the\\r\\nnews, and went their ways again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBreed’s hut was standing only a dozen years ago, though it had long\\r\\nbeen unoccupied. It was about the size of mine. It was set on fire by\\r\\nmischievous boys, one Election night, if I do not mistake. I lived on\\r\\nthe edge of the village then, and had just lost myself over Davenant’s\\r\\nGondibert, that winter that I labored with a lethargy,—which, by the\\r\\nway, I never knew whether to regard as a family complaint, having an\\r\\nuncle who goes to sleep shaving himself, and is obliged to sprout\\r\\npotatoes in a cellar Sundays, in order to keep awake and keep the\\r\\nSabbath, or as the consequence of my attempt to read Chalmers’\\r\\ncollection of English poetry without skipping. It fairly overcame my\\r\\nNervii. I had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire, and\\r\\nin hot haste the engines rolled that way, led by a straggling troop of\\r\\nmen and boys, and I among the foremost, for I had leaped the brook. We\\r\\nthought it was far south over the woods,—we who had run to fires\\r\\nbefore,—barn, shop, or dwelling-house, or all together. “It’s Baker’s\\r\\nbarn,” cried one. “It is the Codman place,” affirmed another. And then\\r\\nfresh sparks went up above the wood, as if the roof fell in, and we all\\r\\nshouted “Concord to the rescue!” Wagons shot past with furious speed\\r\\nand crushing loads, bearing, perchance, among the rest, the agent of\\r\\nthe Insurance Company, who was bound to go however far; and ever and\\r\\nanon the engine bell tinkled behind, more slow and sure; and rearmost\\r\\nof all, as it was afterward whispered, came they who set the fire and\\r\\ngave the alarm. Thus we kept on like true idealists, rejecting the\\r\\nevidence of our senses, until at a turn in the road we heard the\\r\\ncrackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the wall,\\r\\nand realized, alas! that we were there. The very nearness of the fire\\r\\nbut cooled our ardor. At first we thought to throw a frog-pond on to\\r\\nit; but concluded to let it burn, it was so far gone and so worthless.\\r\\nSo we stood round our engine, jostled one another, expressed our\\r\\nsentiments through speaking-trumpets, or in lower tone referred to the\\r\\ngreat conflagrations which the world has witnessed, including Bascom’s\\r\\nshop, and, between ourselves, we thought that, were we there in season\\r\\nwith our “tub,” and a full frog-pond by, we could turn that threatened\\r\\nlast and universal one into another flood. We finally retreated without\\r\\ndoing any mischief,—returned to sleep and Gondibert. But as for\\r\\nGondibert, I would except that passage in the preface about wit being\\r\\nthe soul’s powder,—“but most of mankind are strangers to wit, as\\r\\nIndians are to powder.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt chanced that I walked that way across the fields the following\\r\\nnight, about the same hour, and hearing a low moaning at this spot, I\\r\\ndrew near in the dark, and discovered the only survivor of the family\\r\\nthat I know, the heir of both its virtues and its vices, who alone was\\r\\ninterested in this burning, lying on his stomach and looking over the\\r\\ncellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath, muttering to\\r\\nhimself, as is his wont. He had been working far off in the river\\r\\nmeadows all day, and had improved the first moments that he could call\\r\\nhis own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth. He gazed into\\r\\nthe cellar from all sides and points of view by turns, always lying\\r\\ndown to it, as if there was some treasure, which he remembered,\\r\\nconcealed between the stones, where there was absolutely nothing but a\\r\\nheap of bricks and ashes. The house being gone, he looked at what there\\r\\nwas left. He was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presence\\r\\nimplied, and showed me, as well as the darkness permitted, where the\\r\\nwell was covered up; which, thank Heaven, could never be burned; and he\\r\\ngroped long about the wall to find the well-sweep which his father had\\r\\ncut and mounted, feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden\\r\\nhad been fastened to the heavy end,—all that he could now cling to,—to\\r\\nconvince me that it was no common “rider.” I felt it, and still remark\\r\\nit almost daily in my walks, for by it hangs the history of a family.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more, on the left, where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the\\r\\nwall, in the now open field, lived Nutting and Le Grosse. But to return\\r\\ntoward Lincoln.\\r\\n\\r\\nFarther in the woods than any of these, where the road approaches\\r\\nnearest to the pond, Wyman the potter squatted, and furnished his\\r\\ntownsmen with earthen ware, and left descendants to succeed him.\\r\\nNeither were they rich in worldly goods, holding the land by sufferance\\r\\nwhile they lived; and there often the sheriff came in vain to collect\\r\\nthe taxes, and “attached a chip,” for form’s sake, as I have read in\\r\\nhis accounts, there being nothing else that he could lay his hands on.\\r\\nOne day in midsummer, when I was hoeing, a man who was carrying a load\\r\\nof pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquired\\r\\nconcerning Wyman the younger. He had long ago bought a potter’s wheel\\r\\nof him, and wished to know what had become of him. I had read of the\\r\\npotter’s clay and wheel in Scripture, but it had never occurred to me\\r\\nthat the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken from those\\r\\ndays, or grown on trees like gourds somewhere, and I was pleased to\\r\\nhear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last inhabitant of these woods before me was an Irishman, Hugh\\r\\nQuoil (if I have spelt his name with coil enough,) who occupied Wyman’s\\r\\ntenement,—Col. Quoil, he was called. Rumor said that he had been a\\r\\nsoldier at Waterloo. If he had lived I should have made him fight his\\r\\nbattles over again. His trade here was that of a ditcher. Napoleon went\\r\\nto St. Helena; Quoil came to Walden Woods. All I know of him is tragic.\\r\\nHe was a man of manners, like one who had seen the world, and was\\r\\ncapable of more civil speech than you could well attend to. He wore a\\r\\ngreat coat in mid-summer, being affected with the trembling delirium,\\r\\nand his face was the color of carmine. He died in the road at the foot\\r\\nof Brister’s Hill shortly after I came to the woods, so that I have not\\r\\nremembered him as a neighbor. Before his house was pulled down, when\\r\\nhis comrades avoided it as “an unlucky castle,” I visited it. There lay\\r\\nhis old clothes curled up by use, as if they were himself, upon his\\r\\nraised plank bed. His pipe lay broken on the hearth, instead of a bowl\\r\\nbroken at the fountain. The last could never have been the symbol of\\r\\nhis death, for he confessed to me that, though he had heard of\\r\\nBrister’s Spring, he had never seen it; and soiled cards, kings of\\r\\ndiamonds spades and hearts, were scattered over the floor. One black\\r\\nchicken which the administrator could not catch, black as night and as\\r\\nsilent, not even croaking, awaiting Reynard, still went to roost in the\\r\\nnext apartment. In the rear there was the dim outline of a garden,\\r\\nwhich had been planted but had never received its first hoeing, owing\\r\\nto those terrible shaking fits, though it was now harvest time. It was\\r\\nover-run with Roman wormwood and beggar-ticks, which last stuck to my\\r\\nclothes for all fruit. The skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched\\r\\nupon the back of the house, a trophy of his last Waterloo; but no warm\\r\\ncap or mittens would he want more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings, with\\r\\nburied cellar stones, and strawberries, raspberries, thimble-berries,\\r\\nhazel-bushes, and sumachs growing in the sunny sward there; some\\r\\npitch-pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the chimney nook, and a\\r\\nsweet-scented black-birch, perhaps, waves where the door-stone was.\\r\\nSometimes the well dent is visible, where once a spring oozed; now dry\\r\\nand tearless grass; or it was covered deep,—not to be discovered till\\r\\nsome late day,—with a flat stone under the sod, when the last of the\\r\\nrace departed. What a sorrowful act must that be,—the covering up of\\r\\nwells! coincident with the opening of wells of tears. These cellar\\r\\ndents, like deserted fox burrows, old holes, are all that is left where\\r\\nonce were the stir and bustle of human life, and “fate, free-will,\\r\\nforeknowledge absolute,” in some form and dialect or other were by\\r\\nturns discussed. But all I can learn of their conclusions amounts to\\r\\njust this, that “Cato and Brister pulled wool;” which is about as\\r\\nedifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and lintel\\r\\nand the sill are gone, unfolding its sweet-scented flowers each spring,\\r\\nto be plucked by the musing traveller; planted and tended once by\\r\\nchildren’s hands, in front-yard plots,—now standing by wall-sides in\\r\\nretired pastures, and giving place to new-rising forests;—the last of\\r\\nthat stirp, sole survivor of that family. Little did the dusky children\\r\\nthink that the puny slip with its two eyes only, which they stuck in\\r\\nthe ground in the shadow of the house and daily watered, would root\\r\\nitself so, and outlive them, and house itself in the rear that shaded\\r\\nit, and grown man’s garden and orchard, and tell their story faintly to\\r\\nthe lone wanderer a half century after they had grown up and\\r\\ndied,—blossoming as fair, and smelling as sweet, as in that first\\r\\nspring. I mark its still tender, civil, cheerful, lilac colors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this small village, germ of something more, why did it fail while\\r\\nConcord keeps its ground? Were there no natural advantages,—no water\\r\\nprivileges, forsooth? Ay, the deep Walden Pond and cool Brister’s\\r\\nSpring,—privilege to drink long and healthy draughts at these, all\\r\\nunimproved by these men but to dilute their glass. They were\\r\\nuniversally a thirsty race. Might not the basket, stable-broom,\\r\\nmat-making, corn-parching, linen-spinning, and pottery business have\\r\\nthrived here, making the wilderness to blossom like the rose, and a\\r\\nnumerous posterity have inherited the land of their fathers? The\\r\\nsterile soil would at least have been proof against a low-land\\r\\ndegeneracy. Alas! how little does the memory of these human inhabitants\\r\\nenhance the beauty of the landscape! Again, perhaps, Nature will try,\\r\\nwith me for a first settler, and my house raised last spring to be the\\r\\noldest in the hamlet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not aware that any man has ever built on the spot which I occupy.\\r\\nDeliver me from a city built on the site of a more ancient city, whose\\r\\nmaterials are ruins, whose gardens cemeteries. The soil is blanched and\\r\\naccursed there, and before that becomes necessary the earth itself will\\r\\nbe destroyed. With such reminiscences I repeopled the woods and lulled\\r\\nmyself asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this season I seldom had a visitor. When the snow lay deepest no\\r\\nwanderer ventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time, but\\r\\nthere I lived as snug as a meadow mouse, or as cattle and poultry which\\r\\nare said to have survived for a long time buried in drifts, even\\r\\nwithout food; or like that early settler’s family in the town of\\r\\nSutton, in this state, whose cottage was completely covered by the\\r\\ngreat snow of 1717 when he was absent, and an Indian found it only by\\r\\nthe hole which the chimney’s breath made in the drift, and so relieved\\r\\nthe family. But no friendly Indian concerned himself about me; nor\\r\\nneeded he, for the master of the house was at home. The Great Snow! How\\r\\ncheerful it is to hear of! When the farmers could not get to the woods\\r\\nand swamps with their teams, and were obliged to cut down the shade\\r\\ntrees before their houses, and when the crust was harder, cut off the\\r\\ntrees in the swamps, ten feet from the ground, as it appeared the next\\r\\nspring.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the deepest snows, the path which I used from the highway to my\\r\\nhouse, about half a mile long, might have been represented by a\\r\\nmeandering dotted line, with wide intervals between the dots. For a\\r\\nweek of even weather I took exactly the same number of steps, and of\\r\\nthe same length, coming and going, stepping deliberately and with the\\r\\nprecision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracks,—to such routine\\r\\nthe winter reduces us,—yet often they were filled with heaven’s own\\r\\nblue. But no weather interfered fatally with my walks, or rather my\\r\\ngoing abroad, for I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the\\r\\ndeepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech-tree, or a\\r\\nyellow-birch, or an old acquaintance among the pines; when the ice and\\r\\nsnow causing their limbs to droop, and so sharpening their tops, had\\r\\nchanged the pines into fir-trees; wading to the tops of the highest\\r\\nhills when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level, and shaking\\r\\ndown another snow-storm on my head at every step; or sometimes creeping\\r\\nand floundering thither on my hands and knees, when the hunters had\\r\\ngone into winter quarters. One afternoon I amused myself by watching a\\r\\nbarred owl (_Strix nebulosa_) sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of\\r\\na white-pine, close to the trunk, in broad daylight, I standing within\\r\\na rod of him. He could hear me when I moved and cronched the snow with\\r\\nmy feet, but could not plainly see me. When I made most noise he would\\r\\nstretch out his neck, and erect his neck feathers, and open his eyes\\r\\nwide; but their lids soon fell again, and he began to nod. I too felt a\\r\\nslumberous influence after watching him half an hour, as he sat thus\\r\\nwith his eyes half open, like a cat, winged brother of the cat. There\\r\\nwas only a narrow slit left between their lids, by which he preserved a\\r\\npeninsular relation to me; thus, with half-shut eyes, looking out from\\r\\nthe land of dreams, and endeavoring to realize me, vague object or mote\\r\\nthat interrupted his visions. At length, on some louder noise or my\\r\\nnearer approach, he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his\\r\\nperch, as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed; and when he\\r\\nlaunched himself off and flapped through the pines, spreading his wings\\r\\nto unexpected breadth, I could not hear the slightest sound from them.\\r\\nThus, guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their\\r\\nneighborhood than by sight, feeling his twilight way as it were with\\r\\nhis sensitive pinions, he found a new perch, where he might in peace\\r\\nawait the dawning of his day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the\\r\\nmeadows, I encountered many a blustering and nipping wind, for nowhere\\r\\nhas it freer play; and when the frost had smitten me on one cheek,\\r\\nheathen as I was, I turned to it the other also. Nor was it much better\\r\\nby the carriage road from Brister’s Hill. For I came to town still,\\r\\nlike a friendly Indian, when the contents of the broad open fields were\\r\\nall piled up between the walls of the Walden road, and half an hour\\r\\nsufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last traveller. And when I\\r\\nreturned new drifts would have formed, through which I floundered,\\r\\nwhere the busy north-west wind had been depositing the powdery snow\\r\\nround a sharp angle in the road, and not a rabbit’s track, nor even the\\r\\nfine print, the small type, of a meadow mouse was to be seen. Yet I\\r\\nrarely failed to find, even in mid-winter, some warm and springly swamp\\r\\nwhere the grass and the skunk-cabbage still put forth with perennial\\r\\nverdure, and some hardier bird occasionally awaited the return of\\r\\nspring.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, notwithstanding the snow, when I returned from my walk at\\r\\nevening I crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my\\r\\ndoor, and found his pile of whittlings on the hearth, and my house\\r\\nfilled with the odor of his pipe. Or on a Sunday afternoon, if I\\r\\nchanced to be at home, I heard the cronching of the snow made by the\\r\\nstep of a long-headed farmer, who from far through the woods sought my\\r\\nhouse, to have a social “crack;” one of the few of his vocation who are\\r\\n“men on their farms;” who donned a frock instead of a professor’s gown,\\r\\nand is as ready to extract the moral out of church or state as to haul\\r\\na load of manure from his barn-yard. We talked of rude and simple\\r\\ntimes, when men sat about large fires in cold bracing weather, with\\r\\nclear heads; and when other dessert failed, we tried our teeth on many\\r\\na nut which wise squirrels have long since abandoned, for those which\\r\\nhave the thickest shells are commonly empty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one who came from farthest to my lodge, through deepest snows and\\r\\nmost dismal tempests, was a poet. A farmer, a hunter, a soldier, a\\r\\nreporter, even a philosopher, may be daunted; but nothing can deter a\\r\\npoet, for he is actuated by pure love. Who can predict his comings and\\r\\ngoings? His business calls him out at all hours, even when doctors\\r\\nsleep. We made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound\\r\\nwith the murmur of much sober talk, making amends then to Walden vale\\r\\nfor the long silences. Broadway was still and deserted in comparison.\\r\\nAt suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter, which\\r\\nmight have been referred indifferently to the last uttered or the\\r\\nforth-coming jest. We made many a “bran new” theory of life over a thin\\r\\ndish of gruel, which combined the advantages of conviviality with the\\r\\nclear-headedness which philosophy requires.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there was\\r\\nanother welcome visitor, who at one time came through the village,\\r\\nthrough snow and rain and darkness, till he saw my lamp through the\\r\\ntrees, and shared with me some long winter evenings. One of the last of\\r\\nthe philosophers,—Connecticut gave him to the world,—he peddled first\\r\\nher wares, afterwards, as he declares, his brains. These he peddles\\r\\nstill, prompting God and disgracing man, bearing for fruit his brain\\r\\nonly, like the nut its kernel. I think that he must be the man of the\\r\\nmost faith of any alive. His words and attitude always suppose a better\\r\\nstate of things than other men are acquainted with, and he will be the\\r\\nlast man to be disappointed as the ages revolve. He has no venture in\\r\\nthe present. But though comparatively disregarded now, when his day\\r\\ncomes, laws unsuspected by most will take effect, and masters of\\r\\nfamilies and rulers will come to him for advice.—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “How blind that cannot see serenity!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA true friend of man; almost the only friend of human progress. An Old\\r\\nMortality, say rather an Immortality, with unwearied patience and faith\\r\\nmaking plain the image engraven in men’s bodies, the God of whom they\\r\\nare but defaced and leaning monuments. With his hospitable intellect he\\r\\nembraces children, beggars, insane, and scholars, and entertains the\\r\\nthought of all, adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance. I\\r\\nthink that he should keep a caravansary on the world’s highway, where\\r\\nphilosophers of all nations might put up, and on his sign should be\\r\\nprinted, “Entertainment for man, but not for his beast. Enter ye that\\r\\nhave leisure and a quiet mind, who earnestly seek the right road.” He\\r\\nis perhaps the sanest man and has the fewest crotchets of any I chance\\r\\nto know; the same yesterday and tomorrow. Of yore we had sauntered and\\r\\ntalked, and effectually put the world behind us; for he was pledged to\\r\\nno institution in it, freeborn, _ingenuus_. Whichever way we turned, it\\r\\nseemed that the heavens and the earth had met together, since he\\r\\nenhanced the beauty of the landscape. A blue-robed man, whose fittest\\r\\nroof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity. I do not see\\r\\nhow he can ever die; Nature cannot spare him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving each some shingles of thought well dried, we sat and whittled\\r\\nthem, trying our knives, and admiring the clear yellowish grain of the\\r\\npumpkin pine. We waded so gently and reverently, or we pulled together\\r\\nso smoothly, that the fishes of thought were not scared from the\\r\\nstream, nor feared any angler on the bank, but came and went grandly,\\r\\nlike the clouds which float through the western sky, and the\\r\\nmother-o’-pearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there. There\\r\\nwe worked, revising mythology, rounding a fable here and there, and\\r\\nbuilding castles in the air for which earth offered no worthy\\r\\nfoundation. Great Looker! Great Expecter! to converse with whom was a\\r\\nNew England Night’s Entertainment. Ah! such discourse we had, hermit\\r\\nand philosopher, and the old settler I have spoken of,—we three,—it\\r\\nexpanded and racked my little house; I should not dare to say how many\\r\\npounds’ weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on every\\r\\ncircular inch; it opened its seams so that they had to be calked with\\r\\nmuch dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leak;—but I had enough\\r\\nof that kind of oakum already picked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one other with whom I had “solid seasons,” long to be\\r\\nremembered, at his house in the village, and who looked in upon me from\\r\\ntime to time; but I had no more for society there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere too, as every where, I sometimes expected the Visitor who never\\r\\ncomes. The Vishnu Purana says, “The house-holder is to remain at\\r\\neventide in his court-yard as long as it takes to milk a cow, or longer\\r\\nif he pleases, to await the arrival of a guest.” I often performed this\\r\\nduty of hospitality, waited long enough to milk a whole herd of cows,\\r\\nbut did not see the man approaching from the town.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWinter Animals\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ponds were firmly frozen, they afforded not only new and\\r\\nshorter routes to many points, but new views from their surfaces of the\\r\\nfamiliar landscape around them. When I crossed Flint’s Pond, after it\\r\\nwas covered with snow, though I had often paddled about and skated over\\r\\nit, it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that I could think of\\r\\nnothing but Baffin’s Bay. The Lincoln hills rose up around me at the\\r\\nextremity of a snowy plain, in which I did not remember to have stood\\r\\nbefore; and the fishermen, at an indeterminable distance over the ice,\\r\\nmoving slowly about with their wolfish dogs, passed for sealers or\\r\\nEsquimaux, or in misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures, and I\\r\\ndid not know whether they were giants or pygmies. I took this course\\r\\nwhen I went to lecture in Lincoln in the evening, travelling in no road\\r\\nand passing no house between my own hut and the lecture room. In Goose\\r\\nPond, which lay in my way, a colony of muskrats dwelt, and raised their\\r\\ncabins high above the ice, though none could be seen abroad when I\\r\\ncrossed it. Walden, being like the rest usually bare of snow, or with\\r\\nonly shallow and interrupted drifts on it, was my yard, where I could\\r\\nwalk freely when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhere\\r\\nand the villagers were confined to their streets. There, far from the\\r\\nvillage street, and except at very long intervals, from the jingle of\\r\\nsleigh-bells, I slid and skated, as in a vast moose-yard well trodden,\\r\\noverhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristling\\r\\nwith icicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor sounds in winter nights, and often in winter days, I heard the\\r\\nforlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far; such a\\r\\nsound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a suitable\\r\\nplectrum, the very _lingua vernacula_ of Walden Wood, and quite\\r\\nfamiliar to me at last, though I never saw the bird while it was making\\r\\nit. I seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it;\\r\\n_Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer, hoo,_ sounded sonorously, and the first three\\r\\nsyllables accented somewhat like _how der do_; or sometimes _hoo hoo_\\r\\nonly. One night in the beginning of winter, before the pond froze over,\\r\\nabout nine o’clock, I was startled by the loud honking of a goose, and,\\r\\nstepping to the door, heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in\\r\\nthe woods as they flew low over my house. They passed over the pond\\r\\ntoward Fair Haven, seemingly deterred from settling by my light, their\\r\\ncommodore honking all the while with a regular beat. Suddenly an\\r\\nunmistakable cat-owl from very near me, with the most harsh and\\r\\ntremendous voice I ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods,\\r\\nresponded at regular intervals to the goose, as if determined to expose\\r\\nand disgrace this intruder from Hudson’s Bay by exhibiting a greater\\r\\ncompass and volume of voice in a native, and _boo-hoo_ him out of\\r\\nConcord horizon. What do you mean by alarming the citadel at this time\\r\\nof night consecrated to me? Do you think I am ever caught napping at\\r\\nsuch an hour, and that I have not got lungs and a larynx as well as\\r\\nyourself? _Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, boo-hoo!_ It was one of the most thrilling\\r\\ndiscords I ever heard. And yet, if you had a discriminating ear, there\\r\\nwere in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor\\r\\nheard.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond, my great bed-fellow\\r\\nin that part of Concord, as if it were restless in its bed and would\\r\\nfain turn over, were troubled with flatulency and had dreams; or I was\\r\\nwaked by the cracking of the ground by the frost, as if some one had\\r\\ndriven a team against my door, and in the morning would find a crack in\\r\\nthe earth a quarter of a mile long and a third of an inch wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes I heard the foxes as they ranged over the snow crust, in\\r\\nmoonlight nights, in search of a partridge or other game, barking\\r\\nraggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs, as if laboring with some\\r\\nanxiety, or seeking expression, struggling for light and to be dogs\\r\\noutright and run freely in the streets; for if we take the ages into\\r\\nour account, may there not be a civilization going on among brutes as\\r\\nwell as men? They seemed to me to be rudimental, burrowing men, still\\r\\nstanding on their defence, awaiting their transformation. Sometimes one\\r\\ncame near to my window, attracted by my light, barked a vulpine curse\\r\\nat me, and then retreated.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsually the red squirrel (_Sciurus Hudsonius_) waked me in the dawn,\\r\\ncoursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house, as if\\r\\nsent out of the woods for this purpose. In the course of the winter I\\r\\nthrew out half a bushel of ears of sweet-corn, which had not got ripe,\\r\\non to the snow crust by my door, and was amused by watching the motions\\r\\nof the various animals which were baited by it. In the twilight and the\\r\\nnight the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal. All day long\\r\\nthe red squirrels came and went, and afforded me much entertainment by\\r\\ntheir manœuvres. One would approach at first warily through the\\r\\nshrub-oaks, running over the snow crust by fits and starts like a leaf\\r\\nblown by the wind, now a few paces this way, with wonderful speed and\\r\\nwaste of energy, making inconceivable haste with his “trotters,” as if\\r\\nit were for a wager, and now as many paces that way, but never getting\\r\\non more than half a rod at a time; and then suddenly pausing with a\\r\\nludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset, as if all the eyes in\\r\\nthe universe were fixed on him,—for all the motions of a squirrel, even\\r\\nin the most solitary recesses of the forest, imply spectators as much\\r\\nas those of a dancing girl,—wasting more time in delay and\\r\\ncircumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distance,—I\\r\\nnever saw one walk,—and then suddenly, before you could say Jack\\r\\nRobinson, he would be in the top of a young pitch-pine, winding up his\\r\\nclock and chiding all imaginary spectators, soliloquizing and talking\\r\\nto all the universe at the same time,—for no reason that I could ever\\r\\ndetect, or he himself was aware of, I suspect. At length he would reach\\r\\nthe corn, and selecting a suitable ear, frisk about in the same\\r\\nuncertain trigonometrical way to the top-most stick of my wood-pile,\\r\\nbefore my window, where he looked me in the face, and there sit for\\r\\nhours, supplying himself with a new ear from time to time, nibbling at\\r\\nfirst voraciously and throwing the half-naked cobs about; till at\\r\\nlength he grew more dainty still and played with his food, tasting only\\r\\nthe inside of the kernel, and the ear, which was held balanced over the\\r\\nstick by one paw, slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the\\r\\nground, when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression of\\r\\nuncertainty, as if suspecting that it had life, with a mind not made up\\r\\nwhether to get it again, or a new one, or be off; now thinking of corn,\\r\\nthen listening to hear what was in the wind. So the little impudent\\r\\nfellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon; till at last, seizing\\r\\nsome longer and plumper one, considerably bigger than himself, and\\r\\nskilfully balancing it, he would set out with it to the woods, like a\\r\\ntiger with a buffalo, by the same zig-zag course and frequent pauses,\\r\\nscratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling\\r\\nall the while, making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and\\r\\nhorizontal, being determined to put it through at any rate;—a\\r\\nsingularly frivolous and whimsical fellow;—and so he would get off with\\r\\nit to where he lived, perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree forty\\r\\nor fifty rods distant, and I would afterwards find the cobs strewn\\r\\nabout the woods in various directions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the jays arrive, whose discordant screams were heard long\\r\\nbefore, as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile\\r\\noff, and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree,\\r\\nnearer and nearer, and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have\\r\\ndropped. Then, sitting on a pitch-pine bough, they attempt to swallow\\r\\nin their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes\\r\\nthem; and after great labor they disgorge it, and spend an hour in the\\r\\nendeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills. They were\\r\\nmanifestly thieves, and I had not much respect for them; but the\\r\\nsquirrels, though at first shy, went to work as if they were taking\\r\\nwhat was their own.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks, which, picking up the\\r\\ncrumbs the squirrels had dropped, flew to the nearest twig, and,\\r\\nplacing them under their claws, hammered away at them with their little\\r\\nbills, as if it were an insect in the bark, till they were sufficiently\\r\\nreduced for their slender throats. A little flock of these tit-mice\\r\\ncame daily to pick a dinner out of my wood-pile, or the crumbs at my\\r\\ndoor, with faint flitting lisping notes, like the tinkling of icicles\\r\\nin the grass, or else with sprightly _day day day_, or more rarely, in\\r\\nspring-like days, a wiry summery _phe-be_ from the wood-side. They were\\r\\nso familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which I\\r\\nwas carrying in, and pecked at the sticks without fear. I once had a\\r\\nsparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while I was hoeing in a\\r\\nvillage garden, and I felt that I was more distinguished by that\\r\\ncircumstance than I should have been by any epaulet I could have worn.\\r\\nThe squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar, and occasionally\\r\\nstepped upon my shoe, when that was the nearest way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ground was not yet quite covered, and again near the end of\\r\\nwinter, when the snow was melted on my south hill-side and about my\\r\\nwood-pile, the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to\\r\\nfeed there. Whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts\\r\\naway on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs\\r\\non high, which comes sifting down in the sun-beams like golden dust;\\r\\nfor this brave bird is not to be scared by winter. It is frequently\\r\\ncovered up by drifts, and, it is said, “sometimes plunges from on wing\\r\\ninto the soft snow, where it remains concealed for a day or two.” I\\r\\nused to start them in the open land also, where they had come out of\\r\\nthe woods at sunset to “bud” the wild apple-trees. They will come\\r\\nregularly every evening to particular trees, where the cunning\\r\\nsportsman lies in wait for them, and the distant orchards next the\\r\\nwoods suffer thus not a little. I am glad that the partridge gets fed,\\r\\nat any rate. It is Nature’s own bird which lives on buds and\\r\\ndiet-drink.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn dark winter mornings, or in short winter afternoons, I sometimes\\r\\nheard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and\\r\\nyelp, unable to resist the instinct of the chase, and the note of the\\r\\nhunting horn at intervals, proving that man was in the rear. The woods\\r\\nring again, and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the\\r\\npond, nor following pack pursuing their Actæon. And perhaps at evening\\r\\nI see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their\\r\\nsleigh for a trophy, seeking their inn. They tell me that if the fox\\r\\nwould remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe, or if\\r\\nhe would run in a straight line away no fox-hound could overtake him;\\r\\nbut, having left his pursuers far behind, he stops to rest and listen\\r\\ntill they come up, and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts,\\r\\nwhere the hunters await him. Sometimes, however, he will run upon a\\r\\nwall many rods, and then leap off far to one side, and he appears to\\r\\nknow that water will not retain his scent. A hunter told me that he\\r\\nonce saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to Walden when the ice\\r\\nwas covered with shallow puddles, run part way across, and then return\\r\\nto the same shore. Ere long the hounds arrived, but here they lost the\\r\\nscent. Sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door, and\\r\\ncircle round my house, and yelp and hound without regarding me, as if\\r\\nafflicted by a species of madness, so that nothing could divert them\\r\\nfrom the pursuit. Thus they circle until they fall upon the recent\\r\\ntrail of a fox, for a wise hound will forsake every thing else for\\r\\nthis. One day a man came to my hut from Lexington to inquire after his\\r\\nhound that made a large track, and had been hunting for a week by\\r\\nhimself. But I fear that he was not the wiser for all I told him, for\\r\\nevery time I attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by\\r\\nasking, “What do you do here?” He had lost a dog, but found a man.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne old hunter who has a dry tongue, who used to come to bathe in\\r\\nWalden once every year when the water was warmest, and at such times\\r\\nlooked in upon me, told me that many years ago he took his gun one\\r\\nafternoon and went out for a cruise in Walden Wood; and as he walked\\r\\nthe Wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching, and ere long a\\r\\nfox leaped the wall into the road, and as quick as thought leaped the\\r\\nother wall out of the road, and his swift bullet had not touched him.\\r\\nSome way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit,\\r\\nhunting on their own account, and disappeared again in the woods. Late\\r\\nin the afternoon, as he was resting in the thick woods south of Walden,\\r\\nhe heard the voice of the hounds far over toward Fair Haven still\\r\\npursuing the fox; and on they came, their hounding cry which made all\\r\\nthe woods ring sounding nearer and nearer, now from Well-Meadow, now\\r\\nfrom the Baker Farm. For a long time he stood still and listened to\\r\\ntheir music, so sweet to a hunter’s ear, when suddenly the fox\\r\\nappeared, threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace, whose\\r\\nsound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves, swift and\\r\\nstill, keeping the ground, leaving his pursuers far behind; and,\\r\\nleaping upon a rock amid the woods, he sat erect and listening, with\\r\\nhis back to the hunter. For a moment compassion restrained the latter’s\\r\\narm; but that was a short-lived mood, and as quick as thought can\\r\\nfollow thought his piece was levelled, and _whang!_—the fox rolling\\r\\nover the rock lay dead on the ground. The hunter still kept his place\\r\\nand listened to the hounds. Still on they came, and now the near woods\\r\\nresounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry. At length\\r\\nthe old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground, and snapping\\r\\nthe air as if possessed, and ran directly to the rock; but spying the\\r\\ndead fox she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with\\r\\namazement, and walked round and round him in silence; and one by one\\r\\nher pups arrived, and, like their mother, were sobered into silence by\\r\\nthe mystery. Then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst, and\\r\\nthe mystery was solved. They waited in silence while he skinned the\\r\\nfox, then followed the brush a while, and at length turned off into the\\r\\nwoods again. That evening a Weston Squire came to the Concord hunter’s\\r\\ncottage to inquire for his hounds, and told how for a week they had\\r\\nbeen hunting on their own account from Weston woods. The Concord hunter\\r\\ntold him what he knew and offered him the skin; but the other declined\\r\\nit and departed. He did not find his hounds that night, but the next\\r\\nday learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farm-house\\r\\nfor the night, whence, having been well fed, they took their departure\\r\\nearly in the morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hunter who told me this could remember one Sam Nutting, who used to\\r\\nhunt bears on Fair Haven Ledges, and exchange their skins for rum in\\r\\nConcord village; who told him, even, that he had seen a moose there.\\r\\nNutting had a famous fox-hound named Burgoyne,—he pronounced it\\r\\nBugine,—which my informant used to borrow. In the “Wast Book” of an old\\r\\ntrader of this town, who was also a captain, town-clerk, and\\r\\nrepresentative, I find the following entry. Jan. 18th, 1742–3, “John\\r\\nMelven Cr. by 1 Grey Fox 0—2—3;” they are not now found here; and in\\r\\nhis ledger, Feb. 7th, 1743, Hezekiah Stratton has credit “by ½ a Catt\\r\\nskin 0—1—4½;” of course, a wild-cat, for Stratton was a sergeant in the\\r\\nold French war, and would not have got credit for hunting less noble\\r\\ngame. Credit is given for deer skins also, and they were daily sold.\\r\\nOne man still preserves the horns of the last deer that was killed in\\r\\nthis vicinity, and another has told me the particulars of the hunt in\\r\\nwhich his uncle was engaged. The hunters were formerly a numerous and\\r\\nmerry crew here. I remember well one gaunt Nimrod who would catch up a\\r\\nleaf by the road-side and play a strain on it wilder and more\\r\\nmelodious, if my memory serves me, than any hunting-horn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midnight, when there was a moon, I sometimes met with hounds in my\\r\\npath prowling about the woods, which would skulk out of my way, as if\\r\\nafraid, and stand silent amid the bushes till I had passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSquirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts. There were\\r\\nscores of pitch-pines around my house, from one to four inches in\\r\\ndiameter, which had been gnawed by mice the previous winter,—a\\r\\nNorwegian winter for them, for the snow lay long and deep, and they\\r\\nwere obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other\\r\\ndiet. These trees were alive and apparently flourishing at mid-summer,\\r\\nand many of them had grown a foot, though completely girdled; but after\\r\\nanother winter such were without exception dead. It is remarkable that\\r\\na single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinner,\\r\\ngnawing round instead of up and down it; but perhaps it is necessary in\\r\\norder to thin these trees, which are wont to grow up densely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hares (_Lepus Americanus_) were very familiar. One had her form\\r\\nunder my house all winter, separated from me only by the flooring, and\\r\\nshe startled me each morning by her hasty departure when I began to\\r\\nstir,—thump, thump, thump, striking her head against the floor timbers\\r\\nin her hurry. They used to come round my door at dusk to nibble the\\r\\npotato parings which I had thrown out, and were so nearly the color of\\r\\nthe ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still.\\r\\nSometimes in the twilight I alternately lost and recovered sight of one\\r\\nsitting motionless under my window. When I opened my door in the\\r\\nevening, off they would go with a squeak and a bounce. Near at hand\\r\\nthey only excited my pity. One evening one sat by my door two paces\\r\\nfrom me, at first trembling with fear, yet unwilling to move; a poor\\r\\nwee thing, lean and bony, with ragged ears and sharp nose, scant tail\\r\\nand slender paws. It looked as if Nature no longer contained the breed\\r\\nof nobler bloods, but stood on her last toes. Its large eyes appeared\\r\\nyoung and unhealthy, almost dropsical. I took a step, and lo, away it\\r\\nscud with an elastic spring over the snow crust, straightening its body\\r\\nand its limbs into graceful length, and soon put the forest between me\\r\\nand itself,—the wild free venison, asserting its vigor and the dignity\\r\\nof Nature. Not without reason was its slenderness. Such then was its\\r\\nnature. (_Lepus_, _levipes_, light-foot, some think.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is a country without rabbits and partridges? They are among the\\r\\nmost simple and indigenous animal products; ancient and venerable\\r\\nfamilies known to antiquity as to modern times; of the very hue and\\r\\nsubstance of Nature, nearest allied to leaves and to the ground,—and to\\r\\none another; it is either winged or it is legged. It is hardly as if\\r\\nyou had seen a wild creature when a rabbit or a partridge bursts away,\\r\\nonly a natural one, as much to be expected as rustling leaves. The\\r\\npartridge and the rabbit are still sure to thrive, like true natives of\\r\\nthe soil, whatever revolutions occur. If the forest is cut off, the\\r\\nsprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment, and they\\r\\nbecome more numerous than ever. That must be a poor country indeed that\\r\\ndoes not support a hare. Our woods teem with them both, and around\\r\\nevery swamp may be seen the partridge or rabbit walk, beset with twiggy\\r\\nfences and horse-hair snares, which some cow-boy tends.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pond in Winter\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a still winter night I awoke with the impression that some\\r\\nquestion had been put to me, which I had been endeavoring in vain to\\r\\nanswer in my sleep, as what—how—when—where? But there was dawning\\r\\nNature, in whom all creatures live, looking in at my broad windows with\\r\\nserene and satisfied face, and no question on _her_ lips. I awoke to an\\r\\nanswered question, to Nature and daylight. The snow lying deep on the\\r\\nearth dotted with young pines, and the very slope of the hill on which\\r\\nmy house is placed, seemed to say, Forward! Nature puts no question and\\r\\nanswers none which we mortals ask. She has long ago taken her\\r\\nresolution. “O Prince, our eyes contemplate with admiration and\\r\\ntransmit to the soul the wonderful and varied spectacle of this\\r\\nuniverse. The night veils without doubt a part of this glorious\\r\\ncreation; but day comes to reveal to us this great work, which extends\\r\\nfrom earth even into the plains of the ether.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThen to my morning work. First I take an axe and pail and go in search\\r\\nof water, if that be not a dream. After a cold and snowy night it\\r\\nneeded a divining rod to find it. Every winter the liquid and trembling\\r\\nsurface of the pond, which was so sensitive to every breath, and\\r\\nreflected every light and shadow, becomes solid to the depth of a foot\\r\\nor a foot and a half, so that it will support the heaviest teams, and\\r\\nperchance the snow covers it to an equal depth, and it is not to be\\r\\ndistinguished from any level field. Like the marmots in the surrounding\\r\\nhills, it closes its eye-lids and becomes dormant for three months or\\r\\nmore. Standing on the snow-covered plain, as if in a pasture amid the\\r\\nhills, I cut my way first through a foot of snow, and then a foot of\\r\\nice, and open a window under my feet, where, kneeling to drink, I look\\r\\ndown into the quiet parlor of the fishes, pervaded by a softened light\\r\\nas through a window of ground glass, with its bright sanded floor the\\r\\nsame as in summer; there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in the\\r\\namber twilight sky, corresponding to the cool and even temperament of\\r\\nthe inhabitants. Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in the morning, while all things are crisp with frost, men come\\r\\nwith fishing reels and slender lunch, and let down their fine lines\\r\\nthrough the snowy field to take pickerel and perch; wild men, who\\r\\ninstinctively follow other fashions and trust other authorities than\\r\\ntheir townsmen, and by their goings and comings stitch towns together\\r\\nin parts where else they would be ripped. They sit and eat their\\r\\nluncheon in stout fear-naughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore, as\\r\\nwise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial. They never\\r\\nconsulted with books, and know and can tell much less than they have\\r\\ndone. The things which they practise are said not yet to be known. Here\\r\\nis one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait. You look into\\r\\nhis pail with wonder as into a summer pond, as if he kept summer locked\\r\\nup at home, or knew where she had retreated. How, pray, did he get\\r\\nthese in mid-winter? O, he got worms out of rotten logs since the\\r\\nground froze, and so he caught them. His life itself passes deeper in\\r\\nNature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate; himself a subject\\r\\nfor the naturalist. The latter raises the moss and bark gently with his\\r\\nknife in search of insects; the former lays open logs to their core\\r\\nwith his axe, and moss and bark fly far and wide. He gets his living by\\r\\nbarking trees. Such a man has some right to fish, and I love to see\\r\\nNature carried out in him. The perch swallows the grub-worm, the\\r\\npickerel swallows the perch, and the fisher-man swallows the pickerel;\\r\\nand so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I strolled around the pond in misty weather I was sometimes amused\\r\\nby the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted. He would\\r\\nperhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice,\\r\\nwhich were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the\\r\\nshore, and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to prevent\\r\\nits being pulled through, have passed the slack line over a twig of the\\r\\nalder, a foot or more above the ice, and tied a dry oak leaf to it,\\r\\nwhich, being pulled down, would show when he had a bite. These alders\\r\\nloomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half way\\r\\nround the pond.\\r\\n\\r\\nAh, the pickerel of Walden! when I see them lying on the ice, or in the\\r\\nwell which the fisherman cuts in the ice, making a little hole to admit\\r\\nthe water, I am always surprised by their rare beauty, as if they were\\r\\nfabulous fishes, they are so foreign to the streets, even to the woods,\\r\\nforeign as Arabia to our Concord life. They possess a quite dazzling\\r\\nand transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval from\\r\\nthe cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in our streets.\\r\\nThey are not green like the pines, nor gray like the stones, nor blue\\r\\nlike the sky; but they have, to my eyes, if possible, yet rarer colors,\\r\\nlike flowers and precious stones, as if they were the pearls, the\\r\\nanimalized _nuclei_ or crystals of the Walden water. They, of course,\\r\\nare Walden all over and all through; are themselves small Waldens in\\r\\nthe animal kingdom, Waldenses. It is surprising that they are caught\\r\\nhere,—that in this deep and capacious spring, far beneath the rattling\\r\\nteams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the Walden road,\\r\\nthis great gold and emerald fish swims. I never chanced to see its kind\\r\\nin any market; it would be the cynosure of all eyes there. Easily, with\\r\\na few convulsive quirks, they give up their watery ghosts, like a\\r\\nmortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwalden_pond_map\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of Walden Pond, I\\r\\nsurveyed it carefully, before the ice broke up, early in ’46, with\\r\\ncompass and chain and sounding line. There have been many stories told\\r\\nabout the bottom, or rather no bottom, of this pond, which certainly\\r\\nhad no foundation for themselves. It is remarkable how long men will\\r\\nbelieve in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to\\r\\nsound it. I have visited two such Bottomless Ponds in one walk in this\\r\\nneighborhood. Many have believed that Walden reached quite through to\\r\\nthe other side of the globe. Some who have lain flat on the ice for a\\r\\nlong time, looking down through the illusive medium, perchance with\\r\\nwatery eyes into the bargain, and driven to hasty conclusions by the\\r\\nfear of catching cold in their breasts, have seen vast holes “into\\r\\nwhich a load of hay might be driven,” if there were any body to drive\\r\\nit, the undoubted source of the Styx and entrance to the Infernal\\r\\nRegions from these parts. Others have gone down from the village with a\\r\\n“fifty-six” and a wagon load of inch rope, but yet have failed to find\\r\\nany bottom; for while the “fifty-six” was resting by the way, they were\\r\\npaying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly\\r\\nimmeasurable capacity for marvellousness. But I can assure my readers\\r\\nthat Walden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable, though\\r\\nat an unusual, depth. I fathomed it easily with a cod-line and a stone\\r\\nweighing about a pound and a half, and could tell accurately when the\\r\\nstone left the bottom, by having to pull so much harder before the\\r\\nwater got underneath to help me. The greatest depth was exactly one\\r\\nhundred and two feet; to which may be added the five feet which it has\\r\\nrisen since, making one hundred and seven. This is a remarkable depth\\r\\nfor so small an area; yet not an inch of it can be spared by the\\r\\nimagination. What if all ponds were shallow? Would it not react on the\\r\\nminds of men? I am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a\\r\\nsymbol. While men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to\\r\\nbe bottomless.\\r\\n\\r\\nA factory owner, hearing what depth I had found, thought that it could\\r\\nnot be true, for, judging from his acquaintance with dams, sand would\\r\\nnot lie at so steep an angle. But the deepest ponds are not so deep in\\r\\nproportion to their area as most suppose, and, if drained, would not\\r\\nleave very remarkable valleys. They are not like cups between the\\r\\nhills; for this one, which is so unusually deep for its area, appears\\r\\nin a vertical section through its centre not deeper than a shallow\\r\\nplate. Most ponds, emptied, would leave a meadow no more hollow than we\\r\\nfrequently see. William Gilpin, who is so admirable in all that relates\\r\\nto landscapes, and usually so correct, standing at the head of Loch\\r\\nFyne, in Scotland, which he describes as “a bay of salt water, sixty or\\r\\nseventy fathoms deep, four miles in breadth,” and about fifty miles\\r\\nlong, surrounded by mountains, observes, “If we could have seen it\\r\\nimmediately after the diluvian crash, or whatever convulsion of Nature\\r\\noccasioned it, before the waters gushed in, what a horrid chasm must it\\r\\nhave appeared!\\r\\n\\r\\n     So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low\\r\\n     Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,\\r\\n     Capacious bed of waters—.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if, using the shortest diameter of Loch Fyne, we apply these\\r\\nproportions to Walden, which, as we have seen, appears already in a\\r\\nvertical section only like a shallow plate, it will appear four times\\r\\nas shallow. So much for the _increased_ horrors of the chasm of Loch\\r\\nFyne when emptied. No doubt many a smiling valley with its stretching\\r\\ncornfields occupies exactly such a “horrid chasm,” from which the\\r\\nwaters have receded, though it requires the insight and the far sight\\r\\nof the geologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact.\\r\\nOften an inquisitive eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake in\\r\\nthe low horizon hills, and no subsequent elevation of the plain has\\r\\nbeen necessary to conceal their history. But it is easiest, as they who\\r\\nwork on the highways know, to find the hollows by the puddles after a\\r\\nshower. The amount of it is, the imagination give it the least license,\\r\\ndives deeper and soars higher than Nature goes. So, probably, the depth\\r\\nof the ocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with its\\r\\nbreadth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I sounded through the ice I could determine the shape of the bottom\\r\\nwith greater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which do\\r\\nnot freeze over, and I was surprised at its general regularity. In the\\r\\ndeepest part there are several acres more level than almost any field\\r\\nwhich is exposed to the sun wind and plough. In one instance, on a line\\r\\narbitrarily chosen, the depth did not vary more than one foot in thirty\\r\\nrods; and generally, near the middle, I could calculate the variation\\r\\nfor each one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three or\\r\\nfour inches. Some are accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holes\\r\\neven in quiet sandy ponds like this, but the effect of water under\\r\\nthese circumstances is to level all inequalities. The regularity of the\\r\\nbottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of the\\r\\nneighboring hills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayed\\r\\nitself in the soundings quite across the pond, and its direction could\\r\\nbe determined by observing the opposite shore. Cape becomes bar, and\\r\\nplain shoal, and valley and gorge deep water and channel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch, and put\\r\\ndown the soundings, more than a hundred in all, I observed this\\r\\nremarkable coincidence. Having noticed that the number indicating the\\r\\ngreatest depth was apparently in the centre of the map, I laid a rule\\r\\non the map lengthwise, and then breadthwise, and found, to my surprise,\\r\\nthat the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatest\\r\\nbreadth _exactly_ at the point of greatest depth, notwithstanding that\\r\\nthe middle is so nearly level, the outline of the pond far from\\r\\nregular, and the extreme length and breadth were got by measuring into\\r\\nthe coves; and I said to myself, Who knows but this hint would conduct\\r\\nto the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle? Is not\\r\\nthis the rule also for the height of mountains, regarded as the\\r\\nopposite of valleys? We know that a hill is not highest at its\\r\\nnarrowest part.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf five coves, three, or all which had been sounded, were observed to\\r\\nhave a bar quite across their mouths and deeper water within, so that\\r\\nthe bay tended to be an expansion of water within the land not only\\r\\nhorizontally but vertically, and to form a basin or independent pond,\\r\\nthe direction of the two capes showing the course of the bar. Every\\r\\nharbor on the sea-coast, also, has its bar at its entrance. In\\r\\nproportion as the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its length,\\r\\nthe water over the bar was deeper compared with that in the basin.\\r\\nGiven, then, the length and breadth of the cove, and the character of\\r\\nthe surrounding shore, and you have almost elements enough to make out\\r\\na formula for all cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to see how nearly I could guess, with this experience, at the\\r\\ndeepest point in a pond, by observing the outlines of its surface and\\r\\nthe character of its shores alone, I made a plan of White Pond, which\\r\\ncontains about forty-one acres, and, like this, has no island in it,\\r\\nnor any visible inlet or outlet; and as the line of greatest breadth\\r\\nfell very near the line of least breadth, where two opposite capes\\r\\napproached each other and two opposite bays receded, I ventured to mark\\r\\na point a short distance from the latter line, but still on the line of\\r\\ngreatest length, as the deepest. The deepest part was found to be\\r\\nwithin one hundred feet of this, still farther in the direction to\\r\\nwhich I had inclined, and was only one foot deeper, namely, sixty feet.\\r\\nOf course, a stream running through, or an island in the pond, would\\r\\nmake the problem much more complicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we knew all the laws of Nature, we should need only one fact, or the\\r\\ndescription of one actual phenomenon, to infer all the particular\\r\\nresults at that point. Now we know only a few laws, and our result is\\r\\nvitiated, not, of course, by any confusion or irregularity in Nature,\\r\\nbut by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation. Our\\r\\nnotions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instances\\r\\nwhich we detect; but the harmony which results from a far greater\\r\\nnumber of seemingly conflicting, but really concurring, laws, which we\\r\\nhave not detected, is still more wonderful. The particular laws are as\\r\\nour points of view, as, to the traveller, a mountain outline varies\\r\\nwith every step, and it has an infinite number of profiles, though\\r\\nabsolutely but one form. Even when cleft or bored through it is not\\r\\ncomprehended in its entireness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics. It is the\\r\\nlaw of average. Such a rule of the two diameters not only guides us\\r\\ntoward the sun in the system and the heart in man, but draw lines\\r\\nthrough the length and breadth of the aggregate of a man’s particular\\r\\ndaily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets, and where\\r\\nthey intersect will be the height or depth of his character. Perhaps we\\r\\nneed only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country or\\r\\ncircumstances, to infer his depth and concealed bottom. If he is\\r\\nsurrounded by mountainous circumstances, an Achillean shore, whose\\r\\npeaks overshadow and are reflected in his bosom, they suggest a\\r\\ncorresponding depth in him. But a low and smooth shore proves him\\r\\nshallow on that side. In our bodies, a bold projecting brow falls off\\r\\nto and indicates a corresponding depth of thought. Also there is a bar\\r\\nacross the entrance of our every cove, or particular inclination; each\\r\\nis our harbor for a season, in which we are detained and partially\\r\\nland-locked. These inclinations are not whimsical usually, but their\\r\\nform, size, and direction are determined by the promontories of the\\r\\nshore, the ancient axes of elevation. When this bar is gradually\\r\\nincreased by storms, tides, or currents, or there is a subsidence of\\r\\nthe waters, so that it reaches to the surface, that which was at first\\r\\nbut an inclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomes\\r\\nan individual lake, cut off from the ocean, wherein the thought secures\\r\\nits own conditions, changes, perhaps, from salt to fresh, becomes a\\r\\nsweet sea, dead sea, or a marsh. At the advent of each individual into\\r\\nthis life, may we not suppose that such a bar has risen to the surface\\r\\nsomewhere? It is true, we are such poor navigators that our thoughts,\\r\\nfor the most part, stand off and on upon a harborless coast, are\\r\\nconversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy, or steer for the\\r\\npublic ports of entry, and go into the dry docks of science, where they\\r\\nmerely refit for this world, and no natural currents concur to\\r\\nindividualize them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the inlet or outlet of Walden, I have not discovered any but\\r\\nrain and snow and evaporation, though perhaps, with a thermometer and a\\r\\nline, such places may be found, for where the water flows into the pond\\r\\nit will probably be coldest in summer and warmest in winter. When the\\r\\nice-men were at work here in ’46–7, the cakes sent to the shore were\\r\\none day rejected by those who were stacking them up there, not being\\r\\nthick enough to lie side by side with the rest; and the cutters thus\\r\\ndiscovered that the ice over a small space was two or three inches\\r\\nthinner than elsewhere, which made them think that there was an inlet\\r\\nthere. They also showed me in another place what they thought was a\\r\\n“leach hole,” through which the pond leaked out under a hill into a\\r\\nneighboring meadow, pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it. It was a\\r\\nsmall cavity under ten feet of water; but I think that I can warrant\\r\\nthe pond not to need soldering till they find a worse leak than that.\\r\\nOne has suggested, that if such a “leach hole” should be found, its\\r\\nconnection with the meadow, if any existed, might be proved by\\r\\nconveying some colored powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole, and\\r\\nthen putting a strainer over the spring in the meadow, which would\\r\\ncatch some of the particles carried through by the current.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I was surveying, the ice, which was sixteen inches thick,\\r\\nundulated under a slight wind like water. It is well known that a level\\r\\ncannot be used on ice. At one rod from the shore its greatest\\r\\nfluctuation, when observed by means of a level on land directed toward\\r\\na graduated staff on the ice, was three quarters of an inch, though the\\r\\nice appeared firmly attached to the shore. It was probably greater in\\r\\nthe middle. Who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough we\\r\\nmight detect an undulation in the crust of the earth? When two legs of\\r\\nmy level were on the shore and the third on the ice, and the sights\\r\\nwere directed over the latter, a rise or fall of the ice of an almost\\r\\ninfinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree across\\r\\nthe pond. When I began to cut holes for sounding, there were three or\\r\\nfour inches of water on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk it\\r\\nthus far; but the water began immediately to run into these holes, and\\r\\ncontinued to run for two days in deep streams, which wore away the ice\\r\\non every side, and contributed essentially, if not mainly, to dry the\\r\\nsurface of the pond; for, as the water ran in, it raised and floated\\r\\nthe ice. This was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a ship\\r\\nto let the water out. When such holes freeze, and a rain succeeds, and\\r\\nfinally a new freezing forms a fresh smooth ice over all, it is\\r\\nbeautifully mottled internally by dark figures, shaped somewhat like a\\r\\nspider’s web, what you may call ice rosettes, produced by the channels\\r\\nworn by the water flowing from all sides to a centre. Sometimes, also,\\r\\nwhen the ice was covered with shallow puddles, I saw a double shadow of\\r\\nmyself, one standing on the head of the other, one on the ice, the\\r\\nother on the trees or hill-side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile yet it is cold January, and snow and ice are thick and solid, the\\r\\nprudent landlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summer\\r\\ndrink; impressively, even pathetically wise, to foresee the heat and\\r\\nthirst of July now in January,—wearing a thick coat and mittens! when\\r\\nso many things are not provided for. It may be that he lays up no\\r\\ntreasures in this world which will cool his summer drink in the next.\\r\\nHe cuts and saws the solid pond, unroofs the house of fishes, and carts\\r\\noff their very element and air, held fast by chains and stakes like\\r\\ncorded wood, through the favoring winter air, to wintry cellars, to\\r\\nunderlie the summer there. It looks like solidified azure, as, far off,\\r\\nit is drawn through the streets. These ice-cutters are a merry race,\\r\\nfull of jest and sport, and when I went among them they were wont to\\r\\ninvite me to saw pit-fashion with them, I standing underneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the winter of ’46–7 there came a hundred men of Hyperborean\\r\\nextraction swoop down on to our pond one morning, with many car-loads\\r\\nof ungainly-looking farming tools, sleds, ploughs, drill-barrows,\\r\\nturf-knives, spades, saws, rakes, and each man was armed with a\\r\\ndouble-pointed pike-staff, such as is not described in the New-England\\r\\nFarmer or the Cultivator. I did not know whether they had come to sow a\\r\\ncrop of winter rye, or some other kind of grain recently introduced\\r\\nfrom Iceland. As I saw no manure, I judged that they meant to skim the\\r\\nland, as I had done, thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallow\\r\\nlong enough. They said that a gentleman farmer, who was behind the\\r\\nscenes, wanted to double his money, which, as I understood, amounted to\\r\\nhalf a million already; but in order to cover each one of his dollars\\r\\nwith another, he took off the only coat, ay, the skin itself, of Walden\\r\\nPond in the midst of a hard winter. They went to work at once,\\r\\nploughing, harrowing, rolling, furrowing, in admirable order, as if\\r\\nthey were bent on making this a model farm; but when I was looking\\r\\nsharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow, a gang of\\r\\nfellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itself,\\r\\nwith a peculiar jerk, clean down to the sand, or rather the water,—for\\r\\nit was a very springy soil,—indeed all the _terra firma_ there was,—and\\r\\nhaul it away on sleds, and then I guessed that they must be cutting\\r\\npeat in a bog. So they came and went every day, with a peculiar shriek\\r\\nfrom the locomotive, from and to some point of the polar regions, as it\\r\\nseemed to me, like a flock of arctic snow-birds. But sometimes Squaw\\r\\nWalden had her revenge, and a hired man, walking behind his team,\\r\\nslipped through a crack in the ground down toward Tartarus, and he who\\r\\nwas so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man, almost\\r\\ngave up his animal heat, and was glad to take refuge in my house, and\\r\\nacknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove; or sometimes the\\r\\nfrozen soil took a piece of steel out of a ploughshare, or a plough got\\r\\nset in the furrow and had to be cut out.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo speak literally, a hundred Irishmen, with Yankee overseers, came\\r\\nfrom Cambridge every day to get out the ice. They divided it into cakes\\r\\nby methods too well known to require description, and these, being\\r\\nsledded to the shore, were rapidly hauled off on to an ice platform,\\r\\nand raised by grappling irons and block and tackle, worked by horses,\\r\\non to a stack, as surely as so many barrels of flour, and there placed\\r\\nevenly side by side, and row upon row, as if they formed the solid base\\r\\nof an obelisk designed to pierce the clouds. They told me that in a\\r\\ngood day they could get out a thousand tons, which was the yield of\\r\\nabout one acre. Deep ruts and “cradle holes” were worn in the ice, as\\r\\non _terra firma_, by the passage of the sleds over the same track, and\\r\\nthe horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed out\\r\\nlike buckets. They stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pile\\r\\nthirty-five feet high on one side and six or seven rods square, putting\\r\\nhay between the outside layers to exclude the air; for when the wind,\\r\\nthough never so cold, finds a passage through, it will wear large\\r\\ncavities, leaving slight supports or studs only here and there, and\\r\\nfinally topple it down. At first it looked like a vast blue fort or\\r\\nValhalla; but when they began to tuck the coarse meadow hay into the\\r\\ncrevices, and this became covered with rime and icicles, it looked like\\r\\na venerable moss-grown and hoary ruin, built of azure-tinted marble,\\r\\nthe abode of Winter, that old man we see in the almanac,—his shanty, as\\r\\nif he had a design to estivate with us. They calculated that not\\r\\ntwenty-five per cent of this would reach its destination, and that two\\r\\nor three per cent would be wasted in the cars. However, a still greater\\r\\npart of this heap had a different destiny from what was intended; for,\\r\\neither because the ice was found not to keep so well as was expected,\\r\\ncontaining more air than usual, or for some other reason, it never got\\r\\nto market. This heap, made in the winter of ’46–7 and estimated to\\r\\ncontain ten thousand tons, was finally covered with hay and boards; and\\r\\nthough it was unroofed the following July, and a part of it carried\\r\\noff, the rest remaining exposed to the sun, it stood over that summer\\r\\nand the next winter, and was not quite melted till September 1848. Thus\\r\\nthe pond recovered the greater part.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the water, the Walden ice, seen near at hand, has a green tint,\\r\\nbut at a distance is beautifully blue, and you can easily tell it from\\r\\nthe white ice of the river, or the merely greenish ice of some ponds, a\\r\\nquarter of a mile off. Sometimes one of those great cakes slips from\\r\\nthe ice-man’s sled into the village street, and lies there for a week\\r\\nlike a great emerald, an object of interest to all passers. I have\\r\\nnoticed that a portion of Walden which in the state of water was green\\r\\nwill often, when frozen, appear from the same point of view blue. So\\r\\nthe hollows about this pond will, sometimes, in the winter, be filled\\r\\nwith a greenish water somewhat like its own, but the next day will have\\r\\nfrozen blue. Perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the\\r\\nlight and air they contain, and the most transparent is the bluest. Ice\\r\\nis an interesting subject for contemplation. They told me that they had\\r\\nsome in the ice-houses at Fresh Pond five years old which was as good\\r\\nas ever. Why is it that a bucket of water soon becomes putrid, but\\r\\nfrozen remains sweet forever? It is commonly said that this is the\\r\\ndifference between the affections and the intellect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus for sixteen days I saw from my window a hundred men at work like\\r\\nbusy husbandmen, with teams and horses and apparently all the\\r\\nimplements of farming, such a picture as we see on the first page of\\r\\nthe almanac; and as often as I looked out I was reminded of the fable\\r\\nof the lark and the reapers, or the parable of the sower, and the like;\\r\\nand now they are all gone, and in thirty days more, probably, I shall\\r\\nlook from the same window on the pure sea-green Walden water there,\\r\\nreflecting the clouds and the trees, and sending up its evaporations in\\r\\nsolitude, and no traces will appear that a man has ever stood there.\\r\\nPerhaps I shall hear a solitary loon laugh as he dives and plumes\\r\\nhimself, or shall see a lonely fisher in his boat, like a floating\\r\\nleaf, beholding his form reflected in the waves, where lately a hundred\\r\\nmen securely labored.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New\\r\\nOrleans, of Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well. In the\\r\\nmorning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal\\r\\nphilosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the\\r\\ngods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modern world and\\r\\nits literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is\\r\\nnot to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its\\r\\nsublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well\\r\\nfor water, and lo! there I meet the servant of the Bramin, priest of\\r\\nBrahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges\\r\\nreading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and\\r\\nwater jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and\\r\\nour buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden\\r\\nwater is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges. With favoring\\r\\nwinds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of Atlantis\\r\\nand the Hesperides, makes the periplus of Hanno, and, floating by\\r\\nTernate and Tidore and the mouth of the Persian Gulf, melts in the\\r\\ntropic gales of the Indian seas, and is landed in ports of which\\r\\nAlexander only heard the names.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpring\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening of large tracts by the ice-cutters commonly causes a pond\\r\\nto break up earlier; for the water, agitated by the wind, even in cold\\r\\nweather, wears away the surrounding ice. But such was not the effect on\\r\\nWalden that year, for she had soon got a thick new garment to take the\\r\\nplace of the old. This pond never breaks up so soon as the others in\\r\\nthis neighborhood, on account both of its greater depth and its having\\r\\nno stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice. I never knew\\r\\nit to open in the course of a winter, not excepting that of ’52–3,\\r\\nwhich gave the ponds so severe a trial. It commonly opens about the\\r\\nfirst of April, a week or ten days later than Flint’s Pond and\\r\\nFair-Haven, beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower\\r\\nparts where it began to freeze. It indicates better than any water\\r\\nhereabouts the absolute progress of the season, being least affected by\\r\\ntransient changes of temperature. A severe cold of a few days’ duration\\r\\nin March may very much retard the opening of the former ponds, while\\r\\nthe temperature of Walden increases almost uninterruptedly. A\\r\\nthermometer thrust into the middle of Walden on the 6th of March, 1847,\\r\\nstood at 32°, or freezing point; near the shore at 33°; in the middle\\r\\nof Flint’s Pond, the same day, at 32½°; at a dozen rods from the shore,\\r\\nin shallow water, under ice a foot thick, at 36°. This difference of\\r\\nthree and a half degrees between the temperature of the deep water and\\r\\nthe shallow in the latter pond, and the fact that a great proportion of\\r\\nit is comparatively shallow, show why it should break up so much sooner\\r\\nthan Walden. The ice in the shallowest part was at this time several\\r\\ninches thinner than in the middle. In mid-winter the middle had been\\r\\nthe warmest and the ice thinnest there. So, also, every one who has\\r\\nwaded about the shores of the pond in summer must have perceived how\\r\\nmuch warmer the water is close to the shore, where only three or four\\r\\ninches deep, than a little distance out, and on the surface where it is\\r\\ndeep, than near the bottom. In spring the sun not only exerts an\\r\\ninfluence through the increased temperature of the air and earth, but\\r\\nits heat passes through ice a foot or more thick, and is reflected from\\r\\nthe bottom in shallow water, and so also warms the water and melts the\\r\\nunder side of the ice, at the same time that it is melting it more\\r\\ndirectly above, making it uneven, and causing the air bubbles which it\\r\\ncontains to extend themselves upward and downward until it is\\r\\ncompletely honeycombed, and at last disappears suddenly in a single\\r\\nspring rain. Ice has its grain as well as wood, and when a cake begins\\r\\nto rot or “comb,” that is, assume the appearance of honey-comb,\\r\\nwhatever may be its position, the air cells are at right angles with\\r\\nwhat was the water surface. Where there is a rock or a log rising near\\r\\nto the surface the ice over it is much thinner, and is frequently quite\\r\\ndissolved by this reflected heat; and I have been told that in the\\r\\nexperiment at Cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond,\\r\\nthough the cold air circulated underneath, and so had access to both\\r\\nsides, the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than\\r\\ncounterbalanced this advantage. When a warm rain in the middle of the\\r\\nwinter melts off the snow-ice from Walden, and leaves a hard dark or\\r\\ntransparent ice on the middle, there will be a strip of rotten though\\r\\nthicker white ice, a rod or more wide, about the shores, created by\\r\\nthis reflected heat. Also, as I have said, the bubbles themselves\\r\\nwithin the ice operate as burning-glasses to melt the ice beneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a small\\r\\nscale. Every morning, generally speaking, the shallow water is being\\r\\nwarmed more rapidly than the deep, though it may not be made so warm\\r\\nafter all, and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly until the\\r\\nmorning. The day is an epitome of the year. The night is the winter,\\r\\nthe morning and evening are the spring and fall, and the noon is the\\r\\nsummer. The cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of\\r\\ntemperature. One pleasant morning after a cold night, February 24th,\\r\\n1850, having gone to Flint’s Pond to spend the day, I noticed with\\r\\nsurprise, that when I struck the ice with the head of my axe, it\\r\\nresounded like a gong for many rods around, or as if I had struck on a\\r\\ntight drum-head. The pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise,\\r\\nwhen it felt the influence of the sun’s rays slanted upon it from over\\r\\nthe hills; it stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a\\r\\ngradually increasing tumult, which was kept up three or four hours. It\\r\\ntook a short siesta at noon, and boomed once more toward night, as the\\r\\nsun was withdrawing his influence. In the right stage of the weather a\\r\\npond fires its evening gun with great regularity. But in the middle of\\r\\nthe day, being full of cracks, and the air also being less elastic, it\\r\\nhad completely lost its resonance, and probably fishes and muskrats\\r\\ncould not then have been stunned by a blow on it. The fishermen say\\r\\nthat the “thundering of the pond” scares the fishes and prevents their\\r\\nbiting. The pond does not thunder every evening, and I cannot tell\\r\\nsurely when to expect its thundering; but though I may perceive no\\r\\ndifference in the weather, it does. Who would have suspected so large\\r\\nand cold and thick-skinned a thing to be so sensitive? Yet it has its\\r\\nlaw to which it thunders obedience when it should as surely as the buds\\r\\nexpand in the spring. The earth is all alive and covered with papillæ.\\r\\nThe largest pond is as sensitive to atmospheric changes as the globule\\r\\nof mercury in its tube.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne attraction in coming to the woods to live was that I should have\\r\\nleisure and opportunity to see the spring come in. The ice in the pond\\r\\nat length begins to be honey-combed, and I can set my heel in it as I\\r\\nwalk. Fogs and rains and warmer suns are gradually melting the snow;\\r\\nthe days have grown sensibly longer; and I see how I shall get through\\r\\nthe winter without adding to my wood-pile, for large fires are no\\r\\nlonger necessary. I am on the alert for the first signs of spring, to\\r\\nhear the chance note of some arriving bird, or the striped squirrel’s\\r\\nchirp, for his stores must be now nearly exhausted, or see the\\r\\nwoodchuck venture out of his winter quarters. On the 13th of March,\\r\\nafter I had heard the bluebird, song-sparrow, and red-wing, the ice was\\r\\nstill nearly a foot thick. As the weather grew warmer it was not\\r\\nsensibly worn away by the water, nor broken up and floated off as in\\r\\nrivers, but, though it was completely melted for half a rod in width\\r\\nabout the shore, the middle was merely honey-combed and saturated with\\r\\nwater, so that you could put your foot through it when six inches\\r\\nthick; but by the next day evening, perhaps, after a warm rain followed\\r\\nby fog, it would have wholly disappeared, all gone off with the fog,\\r\\nspirited away. One year I went across the middle only five days before\\r\\nit disappeared entirely. In 1845 Walden was first completely open on\\r\\nthe 1st of April; in ’46, the 25th of March; in ’47, the 8th of April;\\r\\nin ’51, the 28th of March; in ’52, the 18th of April; in ’53, the 23d\\r\\nof March; in ’54, about the 7th of April.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery incident connected with the breaking up of the rivers and ponds\\r\\nand the settling of the weather is particularly interesting to us who\\r\\nlive in a climate of so great extremes. When the warmer days come, they\\r\\nwho dwell near the river hear the ice crack at night with a startling\\r\\nwhoop as loud as artillery, as if its icy fetters were rent from end to\\r\\nend, and within a few days see it rapidly going out. So the alligator\\r\\ncomes out of the mud with quakings of the earth. One old man, who has\\r\\nbeen a close observer of Nature, and seems as thoroughly wise in regard\\r\\nto all her operations as if she had been put upon the stocks when he\\r\\nwas a boy, and he had helped to lay her keel,—who has come to his\\r\\ngrowth, and can hardly acquire more of natural lore if he should live\\r\\nto the age of Methuselah,—told me, and I was surprised to hear him\\r\\nexpress wonder at any of Nature’s operations, for I thought that there\\r\\nwere no secrets between them, that one spring day he took his gun and\\r\\nboat, and thought that he would have a little sport with the ducks.\\r\\nThere was ice still on the meadows, but it was all gone out of the\\r\\nriver, and he dropped down without obstruction from Sudbury, where he\\r\\nlived, to Fair-Haven Pond, which he found, unexpectedly, covered for\\r\\nthe most part with a firm field of ice. It was a warm day, and he was\\r\\nsurprised to see so great a body of ice remaining. Not seeing any\\r\\nducks, he hid his boat on the north or back side of an island in the\\r\\npond, and then concealed himself in the bushes on the south side, to\\r\\nawait them. The ice was melted for three or four rods from the shore,\\r\\nand there was a smooth and warm sheet of water, with a muddy bottom,\\r\\nsuch as the ducks love, within, and he thought it likely that some\\r\\nwould be along pretty soon. After he had lain still there about an hour\\r\\nhe heard a low and seemingly very distant sound, but singularly grand\\r\\nand impressive, unlike any thing he had ever heard, gradually swelling\\r\\nand increasing as if it would have a universal and memorable ending, a\\r\\nsullen rush and roar, which seemed to him all at once like the sound of\\r\\na vast body of fowl coming in to settle there, and, seizing his gun, he\\r\\nstarted up in haste and excited; but he found, to his surprise, that\\r\\nthe whole body of the ice had started while he lay there, and drifted\\r\\nin to the shore, and the sound he had heard was made by its edge\\r\\ngrating on the shore,—at first gently nibbled and crumbled off, but at\\r\\nlength heaving up and scattering its wrecks along the island to a\\r\\nconsiderable height before it came to a stand still.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length the sun’s rays have attained the right angle, and warm winds\\r\\nblow up mist and rain and melt the snow banks, and the sun dispersing\\r\\nthe mist smiles on a checkered landscape of russet and white smoking\\r\\nwith incense, through which the traveller picks his way from islet to\\r\\nislet, cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and rivulets\\r\\nwhose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are bearing\\r\\noff.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew phenomena gave me more delight than to observe the forms which\\r\\nthawing sand and clay assume in flowing down the sides of a deep cut on\\r\\nthe railroad through which I passed on my way to the village, a\\r\\nphenomenon not very common on so large a scale, though the number of\\r\\nfreshly exposed banks of the right material must have been greatly\\r\\nmultiplied since railroads were invented. The material was sand of\\r\\nevery degree of fineness and of various rich colors, commonly mixed\\r\\nwith a little clay. When the frost comes out in the spring, and even in\\r\\na thawing day in the winter, the sand begins to flow down the slopes\\r\\nlike lava, sometimes bursting out through the snow and overflowing it\\r\\nwhere no sand was to be seen before. Innumerable little streams overlap\\r\\nand interlace one with another, exhibiting a sort of hybrid product,\\r\\nwhich obeys half way the law of currents, and half way that of\\r\\nvegetation. As it flows it takes the forms of sappy leaves or vines,\\r\\nmaking heaps of pulpy sprays a foot or more in depth, and resembling,\\r\\nas you look down on them, the laciniated, lobed, and imbricated\\r\\nthalluses of some lichens; or you are reminded of coral, of leopard’s\\r\\npaws or birds’ feet, of brains or lungs or bowels, and excrements of\\r\\nall kinds. It is a truly _grotesque_ vegetation, whose forms and color\\r\\nwe see imitated in bronze, a sort of architectural foliage more ancient\\r\\nand typical than acanthus, chiccory, ivy, vine, or any vegetable\\r\\nleaves; destined perhaps, under some circumstances, to become a puzzle\\r\\nto future geologists. The whole cut impressed me as if it were a cave\\r\\nwith its stalactites laid open to the light. The various shades of the\\r\\nsand are singularly rich and agreeable, embracing the different iron\\r\\ncolors, brown, gray, yellowish, and reddish. When the flowing mass\\r\\nreaches the drain at the foot of the bank it spreads out flatter into\\r\\n_strands_, the separate streams losing their semi-cylindrical form and\\r\\ngradually becoming more flat and broad, running together as they are\\r\\nmore moist, till they form an almost flat _sand_, still variously and\\r\\nbeautifully shaded, but in which you can trace the original forms of\\r\\nvegetation; till at length, in the water itself, they are converted\\r\\ninto _banks_, like those formed off the mouths of rivers, and the forms\\r\\nof vegetation are lost in the ripple marks on the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole bank, which is from twenty to forty feet high, is sometimes\\r\\noverlaid with a mass of this kind of foliage, or sandy rupture, for a\\r\\nquarter of a mile on one or both sides, the produce of one spring day.\\r\\nWhat makes this sand foliage remarkable is its springing into existence\\r\\nthus suddenly. When I see on the one side the inert bank,—for the sun\\r\\nacts on one side first,—and on the other this luxuriant foliage, the\\r\\ncreation of an hour, I am affected as if in a peculiar sense I stood in\\r\\nthe laboratory of the Artist who made the world and me,—had come to\\r\\nwhere he was still at work, sporting on this bank, and with excess of\\r\\nenergy strewing his fresh designs about. I feel as if I were nearer to\\r\\nthe vitals of the globe, for this sandy overflow is something such a\\r\\nfoliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body. You find thus in the\\r\\nvery sands an anticipation of the vegetable leaf. No wonder that the\\r\\nearth expresses itself outwardly in leaves, it so labors with the idea\\r\\ninwardly. The atoms have already learned this law, and are pregnant by\\r\\nit. The overhanging leaf sees here its prototype. _Internally_, whether\\r\\nin the globe or animal body, it is a moist thick _lobe_, a word\\r\\nespecially applicable to the liver and lungs and the _leaves_ of fat,\\r\\n(?e?ß?, _labor_, _lapsus_, to flow or slip downward, a lapsing; ??ß??,\\r\\n_globus_, lobe, globe; also lap, flap, and many other words,)\\r\\n_externally_ a dry thin _leaf_, even as the _f_ and _v_ are a pressed\\r\\nand dried _b_. The radicals of _lobe_ are _lb_, the soft mass of the\\r\\n_b_ (single lobed, or B, double lobed,) with the liquid _l_ behind it\\r\\npressing it forward. In globe, _glb_, the guttural _g_ adds to the\\r\\nmeaning the capacity of the throat. The feathers and wings of birds are\\r\\nstill drier and thinner leaves. Thus, also, you pass from the lumpish\\r\\ngrub in the earth to the airy and fluttering butterfly. The very globe\\r\\ncontinually transcends and translates itself, and becomes winged in its\\r\\norbit. Even ice begins with delicate crystal leaves, as if it had\\r\\nflowed into moulds which the fronds of water plants have impressed on\\r\\nthe watery mirror. The whole tree itself is but one leaf, and rivers\\r\\nare still vaster leaves whose pulp is intervening earth, and towns and\\r\\ncities are the ova of insects in their axils.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the sun withdraws the sand ceases to flow, but in the morning the\\r\\nstreams will start once more and branch and branch again into a myriad\\r\\nof others. You here see perchance how blood vessels are formed. If you\\r\\nlook closely you observe that first there pushes forward from the\\r\\nthawing mass a stream of softened sand with a drop-like point, like the\\r\\nball of the finger, feeling its way slowly and blindly downward, until\\r\\nat last with more heat and moisture, as the sun gets higher, the most\\r\\nfluid portion, in its effort to obey the law to which the most inert\\r\\nalso yields, separates from the latter and forms for itself a\\r\\nmeandering channel or artery within that, in which is seen a little\\r\\nsilvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves\\r\\nor branches to another, and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand. It\\r\\nis wonderful how rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes itself as it\\r\\nflows, using the best material its mass affords to form the sharp edges\\r\\nof its channel. Such are the sources of rivers. In the silicious matter\\r\\nwhich the water deposits is perhaps the bony system, and in the still\\r\\nfiner soil and organic matter the fleshy fibre or cellular tissue. What\\r\\nis man but a mass of thawing clay? The ball of the human finger is but\\r\\na drop congealed. The fingers and toes flow to their extent from the\\r\\nthawing mass of the body. Who knows what the human body would expand\\r\\nand flow out to under a more genial heaven? Is not the hand a spreading\\r\\n_palm_ leaf with its lobes and veins? The ear may be regarded,\\r\\nfancifully, as a lichen, _umbilicaria_, on the side of the head, with\\r\\nits lobe or drop. The lip—_labium_, from _labor_ (?)—laps or lapses\\r\\nfrom the sides of the cavernous mouth. The nose is a manifest congealed\\r\\ndrop or stalactite. The chin is a still larger drop, the confluent\\r\\ndripping of the face. The cheeks are a slide from the brows into the\\r\\nvalley of the face, opposed and diffused by the cheek bones. Each\\r\\nrounded lobe of the vegetable leaf, too, is a thick and now loitering\\r\\ndrop, larger or smaller; the lobes are the fingers of the leaf; and as\\r\\nmany lobes as it has, in so many directions it tends to flow, and more\\r\\nheat or other genial influences would have caused it to flow yet\\r\\nfarther.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus it seemed that this one hillside illustrated the principle of all\\r\\nthe operations of Nature. The Maker of this earth but patented a leaf.\\r\\nWhat Champollion will decipher this hieroglyphic for us, that we may\\r\\nturn over a new leaf at last? This phenomenon is more exhilarating to\\r\\nme than the luxuriance and fertility of vineyards. True, it is somewhat\\r\\nexcrementitious in its character, and there is no end to the heaps of\\r\\nliver lights and bowels, as if the globe were turned wrong side\\r\\noutward; but this suggests at least that Nature has some bowels, and\\r\\nthere again is mother of humanity. This is the frost coming out of the\\r\\nground; this is Spring. It precedes the green and flowery spring, as\\r\\nmythology precedes regular poetry. I know of nothing more purgative of\\r\\nwinter fumes and indigestions. It convinces me that Earth is still in\\r\\nher swaddling clothes, and stretches forth baby fingers on every side.\\r\\nFresh curls spring from the baldest brow. There is nothing inorganic.\\r\\nThese foliaceous heaps lie along the bank like the slag of a furnace,\\r\\nshowing that Nature is “in full blast” within. The earth is not a mere\\r\\nfragment of dead history, stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a\\r\\nbook, to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly, but living\\r\\npoetry like the leaves of a tree, which precede flowers and fruit,—not\\r\\na fossil earth, but a living earth; compared with whose great central\\r\\nlife all animal and vegetable life is merely parasitic. Its throes will\\r\\nheave our exuviæ from their graves. You may melt your metals and cast\\r\\nthem into the most beautiful moulds you can; they will never excite me\\r\\nlike the forms which this molten earth flows out into. And not only it,\\r\\nbut the institutions upon it, are plastic like clay in the hands of the\\r\\npotter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEre long, not only on these banks, but on every hill and plain and in\\r\\nevery hollow, the frost comes out of the ground like a dormant\\r\\nquadruped from its burrow, and seeks the sea with music, or migrates to\\r\\nother climes in clouds. Thaw with his gentle persuasion is more\\r\\npowerful than Thor with his hammer. The one melts, the other but breaks\\r\\nin pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ground was partially bare of snow, and a few warm days had\\r\\ndried its surface somewhat, it was pleasant to compare the first tender\\r\\nsigns of the infant year just peeping forth with the stately beauty of\\r\\nthe withered vegetation which had withstood the\\r\\nwinter,—life-everlasting, golden-rods, pinweeds, and graceful wild\\r\\ngrasses, more obvious and interesting frequently than in summer even,\\r\\nas if their beauty was not ripe till then; even cotton-grass,\\r\\ncat-tails, mulleins, johnswort, hard-hack, meadow-sweet, and other\\r\\nstrong stemmed plants, those unexhausted granaries which entertain the\\r\\nearliest birds,—decent weeds, at least, which widowed Nature wears. I\\r\\nam particularly attracted by the arching and sheaf-like top of the\\r\\nwool-grass; it brings back the summer to our winter memories, and is\\r\\namong the forms which art loves to copy, and which, in the vegetable\\r\\nkingdom, have the same relation to types already in the mind of man\\r\\nthat astronomy has. It is an antique style older than Greek or\\r\\nEgyptian. Many of the phenomena of Winter are suggestive of an\\r\\ninexpressible tenderness and fragile delicacy. We are accustomed to\\r\\nhear this king described as a rude and boisterous tyrant; but with the\\r\\ngentleness of a lover he adorns the tresses of Summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the approach of spring the red-squirrels got under my house, two at\\r\\na time, directly under my feet as I sat reading or writing, and kept up\\r\\nthe queerest chuckling and chirruping and vocal pirouetting and\\r\\ngurgling sounds that ever were heard; and when I stamped they only\\r\\nchirruped the louder, as if past all fear and respect in their mad\\r\\npranks, defying humanity to stop them. No you\\r\\ndon’t—chickaree—chickaree. They were wholly deaf to my arguments, or\\r\\nfailed to perceive their force, and fell into a strain of invective\\r\\nthat was irresistible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first sparrow of spring! The year beginning with younger hope than\\r\\never! The faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and\\r\\nmoist fields from the blue-bird, the song-sparrow, and the red-wing, as\\r\\nif the last flakes of winter tinkled as they fell! What at such a time\\r\\nare histories, chronologies, traditions, and all written revelations?\\r\\nThe brooks sing carols and glees to the spring. The marsh-hawk sailing\\r\\nlow over the meadow is already seeking the first slimy life that\\r\\nawakes. The sinking sound of melting snow is heard in all dells, and\\r\\nthe ice dissolves apace in the ponds. The grass flames up on the\\r\\nhillsides like a spring fire,—“et primitus oritur herba imbribus\\r\\nprimoribus evocata,”—as if the earth sent forth an inward heat to greet\\r\\nthe returning sun; not yellow but green is the color of its flame;—the\\r\\nsymbol of perpetual youth, the grass-blade, like a long green ribbon,\\r\\nstreams from the sod into the summer, checked indeed by the frost, but\\r\\nanon pushing on again, lifting its spear of last year’s hay with the\\r\\nfresh life below. It grows as steadily as the rill oozes out of the\\r\\nground. It is almost identical with that, for in the growing days of\\r\\nJune, when the rills are dry, the grass blades are their channels, and\\r\\nfrom year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream, and\\r\\nthe mower draws from it betimes their winter supply. So our human life\\r\\nbut dies down to its root, and still puts forth its green blade to\\r\\neternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalden is melting apace. There is a canal two rods wide along the\\r\\nnortherly and westerly sides, and wider still at the east end. A great\\r\\nfield of ice has cracked off from the main body. I hear a song-sparrow\\r\\nsinging from the bushes on the shore,—_olit_, _olit_, _olit,_—_chip_,\\r\\n_chip_, _chip_, _che char_,—_che wiss_, _wiss_, _wiss_. He too is\\r\\nhelping to crack it. How handsome the great sweeping curves in the edge\\r\\nof the ice, answering somewhat to those of the shore, but more regular!\\r\\nIt is unusually hard, owing to the recent severe but transient cold,\\r\\nand all watered or waved like a palace floor. But the wind slides\\r\\neastward over its opaque surface in vain, till it reaches the living\\r\\nsurface beyond. It is glorious to behold this ribbon of water sparkling\\r\\nin the sun, the bare face of the pond full of glee and youth, as if it\\r\\nspoke the joy of the fishes within it, and of the sands on its shore,—a\\r\\nsilvery sheen as from the scales of a _leuciscus_, as it were all one\\r\\nactive fish. Such is the contrast between winter and spring. Walden was\\r\\ndead and is alive again. But this spring it broke up more steadily, as\\r\\nI have said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe change from storm and winter to serene and mild weather, from dark\\r\\nand sluggish hours to bright and elastic ones, is a memorable crisis\\r\\nwhich all things proclaim. It is seemingly instantaneous at last.\\r\\nSuddenly an influx of light filled my house, though the evening was at\\r\\nhand, and the clouds of winter still overhung it, and the eaves were\\r\\ndripping with sleety rain. I looked out the window, and lo! where\\r\\nyesterday was cold gray ice there lay the transparent pond already calm\\r\\nand full of hope as in a summer evening, reflecting a summer evening\\r\\nsky in its bosom, though none was visible overhead, as if it had\\r\\nintelligence with some remote horizon. I heard a robin in the distance,\\r\\nthe first I had heard for many a thousand years, methought, whose note\\r\\nI shall not forget for many a thousand more,—the same sweet and\\r\\npowerful song as of yore. O the evening robin, at the end of a New\\r\\nEngland summer day! If I could ever find the twig he sits upon! I mean\\r\\n_he_; I mean _the twig_. This at least is not the _Turdus migratorius_.\\r\\nThe pitch-pines and shrub-oaks about my house, which had so long\\r\\ndrooped, suddenly resumed their several characters, looked brighter,\\r\\ngreener, and more erect and alive, as if effectually cleansed and\\r\\nrestored by the rain. I knew that it would not rain any more. You may\\r\\ntell by looking at any twig of the forest, ay, at your very wood-pile,\\r\\nwhether its winter is past or not. As it grew darker, I was startled by\\r\\nthe _honking_ of geese flying low over the woods, like weary travellers\\r\\ngetting in late from southern lakes, and indulging at last in\\r\\nunrestrained complaint and mutual consolation. Standing at my door, I\\r\\ncould hear the rush of their wings; when, driving toward my house, they\\r\\nsuddenly spied my light, and with hushed clamor wheeled and settled in\\r\\nthe pond. So I came in, and shut the door, and passed my first spring\\r\\nnight in the woods.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning I watched the geese from the door through the mist,\\r\\nsailing in the middle of the pond, fifty rods off, so large and\\r\\ntumultuous that Walden appeared like an artificial pond for their\\r\\namusement. But when I stood on the shore they at once rose up with a\\r\\ngreat flapping of wings at the signal of their commander, and when they\\r\\nhad got into rank circled about over my head, twenty-nine of them, and\\r\\nthen steered straight to Canada, with a regular _honk_ from the leader\\r\\nat intervals, trusting to break their fast in muddier pools. A “plump”\\r\\nof ducks rose at the same time and took the route to the north in the\\r\\nwake of their noisier cousins.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a week I heard the circling, groping clangor of some solitary goose\\r\\nin the foggy mornings, seeking its companion, and still peopling the\\r\\nwoods with the sound of a larger life than they could sustain. In April\\r\\nthe pigeons were seen again flying express in small flocks, and in due\\r\\ntime I heard the martins twittering over my clearing, though it had not\\r\\nseemed that the township contained so many that it could afford me any,\\r\\nand I fancied that they were peculiarly of the ancient race that dwelt\\r\\nin hollow trees ere white men came. In almost all climes the tortoise\\r\\nand the frog are among the precursors and heralds of this season, and\\r\\nbirds fly with song and glancing plumage, and plants spring and bloom,\\r\\nand winds blow, to correct this slight oscillation of the poles and\\r\\npreserve the equilibrium of Nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs every season seems best to us in its turn, so the coming in of\\r\\nspring is like the creation of Cosmos out of Chaos and the realization\\r\\nof the Golden Age.—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Eurus ad Auroram Nabathæaque regna recessit,\\r\\n     Persidaque, et radiis juga subdita matutinis.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     “The East-Wind withdrew to Aurora and the Nabathæan kingdom,\\r\\n     And the Persian, and the ridges placed under the morning rays\\r\\n\\r\\n            *    *    *    *\\r\\n\\r\\n     Man was born.  Whether that Artificer of things,\\r\\n     The origin of a better world, made him from the divine seed;\\r\\n     Or the earth, being recent and lately sundered from the high\\r\\n     Ether, retained some seeds of cognate heaven.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener. So our\\r\\nprospects brighten on the influx of better thoughts. We should be\\r\\nblessed if we lived in the present always, and took advantage of every\\r\\naccident that befell us, like the grass which confesses the influence\\r\\nof the slightest dew that falls on it; and did not spend our time in\\r\\natoning for the neglect of past opportunities, which we call doing our\\r\\nduty. We loiter in winter while it is already spring. In a pleasant\\r\\nspring morning all men’s sins are forgiven. Such a day is a truce to\\r\\nvice. While such a sun holds out to burn, the vilest sinner may return.\\r\\nThrough our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of our\\r\\nneighbors. You may have known your neighbor yesterday for a thief, a\\r\\ndrunkard, or a sensualist, and merely pitied or despised him, and\\r\\ndespaired of the world; but the sun shines bright and warm this first\\r\\nspring morning, re-creating the world, and you meet him at some serene\\r\\nwork, and see how his exhausted and debauched veins expand with still\\r\\njoy and bless the new day, feel the spring influence with the innocence\\r\\nof infancy, and all his faults are forgotten. There is not only an\\r\\natmosphere of good will about him, but even a savor of holiness groping\\r\\nfor expression, blindly and ineffectually perhaps, like a new-born\\r\\ninstinct, and for a short hour the south hill-side echoes to no vulgar\\r\\njest. You see some innocent fair shoots preparing to burst from his\\r\\ngnarled rind and try another year’s life, tender and fresh as the\\r\\nyoungest plant. Even he has entered into the joy of his Lord. Why the\\r\\njailer does not leave open his prison doors,—why the judge does not\\r\\ndismis his case,—why the preacher does not dismiss his congregation! It\\r\\nis because they do not obey the hint which God gives them, nor accept\\r\\nthe pardon which he freely offers to all.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A return to goodness produced each day in the tranquil and beneficent\\r\\nbreath of the morning, causes that in respect to the love of virtue and\\r\\nthe hatred of vice, one approaches a little the primitive nature of\\r\\nman, as the sprouts of the forest which has been felled. In like manner\\r\\nthe evil which one does in the interval of a day prevents the germs of\\r\\nvirtues which began to spring up again from developing themselves and\\r\\ndestroys them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After the germs of virtue have thus been prevented many times from\\r\\ndeveloping themselves, then the beneficent breath of evening does not\\r\\nsuffice to preserve them. As soon as the breath of evening does not\\r\\nsuffice longer to preserve them, then the nature of man does not differ\\r\\nmuch from that of the brute. Men seeing the nature of this man like\\r\\nthat of the brute, think that he has never possessed the innate faculty\\r\\nof reason. Are those the true and natural sentiments of man?”\\r\\n\\r\\n     “The Golden Age was first created, which without any avenger\\r\\n     Spontaneously without law cherished fidelity and rectitude.\\r\\n     Punishment and fear were not; nor were threatening words read\\r\\n     On suspended brass; nor did the suppliant crowd fear\\r\\n     The words of their judge; but were safe without an avenger.\\r\\n     Not yet the pine felled on its mountains had descended\\r\\n     To the liquid waves that it might see a foreign world,\\r\\n     And mortals knew no shores but their own.\\r\\n            *    *    *    *\\r\\n     There was eternal spring, and placid zephyrs with warm\\r\\n     Blasts soothed the flowers born without seed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 29th of April, as I was fishing from the bank of the river near\\r\\nthe Nine-Acre-Corner bridge, standing on the quaking grass and willow\\r\\nroots, where the muskrats lurk, I heard a singular rattling sound,\\r\\nsomewhat like that of the sticks which boys play with their fingers,\\r\\nwhen, looking up, I observed a very slight and graceful hawk, like a\\r\\nnight-hawk, alternately soaring like a ripple and tumbling a rod or two\\r\\nover and over, showing the underside of its wings, which gleamed like a\\r\\nsatin ribbon in the sun, or like the pearly inside of a shell. This\\r\\nsight reminded me of falconry and what nobleness and poetry are\\r\\nassociated with that sport. The Merlin it seemed to me it might be\\r\\ncalled: but I care not for its name. It was the most ethereal flight I\\r\\nhad ever witnessed. It did not simply flutter like a butterfly, nor\\r\\nsoar like the larger hawks, but it sported with proud reliance in the\\r\\nfields of air; mounting again and again with its strange chuckle, it\\r\\nrepeated its free and beautiful fall, turning over and over like a\\r\\nkite, and then recovering from its lofty tumbling, as if it had never\\r\\nset its foot on _terra firma_. It appeared to have no companion in the\\r\\nuniverse,—sporting there alone,—and to need none but the morning and\\r\\nthe ether with which it played. It was not lonely, but made all the\\r\\nearth lonely beneath it. Where was the parent which hatched it, its\\r\\nkindred, and its father in the heavens? The tenant of the air, it\\r\\nseemed related to the earth but by an egg hatched some time in the\\r\\ncrevice of a crag;—or was its native nest made in the angle of a cloud,\\r\\nwoven of the rainbow’s trimmings and the sunset sky, and lined with\\r\\nsome soft midsummer haze caught up from earth? Its eyry now some cliffy\\r\\ncloud.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside this I got a rare mess of golden and silver and bright cupreous\\r\\nfishes, which looked like a string of jewels. Ah! I have penetrated to\\r\\nthose meadows on the morning of many a first spring day, jumping from\\r\\nhummock to hummock, from willow root to willow root, when the wild\\r\\nriver valley and the woods were bathed in so pure and bright a light as\\r\\nwould have waked the dead, if they had been slumbering in their graves,\\r\\nas some suppose. There needs no stronger proof of immortality. All\\r\\nthings must live in such a light. O Death, where was thy sting? O\\r\\nGrave, where was thy victory, then?\\r\\n\\r\\nOur village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored\\r\\nforests and meadows which surround it. We need the tonic of\\r\\nwildness,—to wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the\\r\\nmeadow-hen lurk, and hear the booming of the snipe; to smell the\\r\\nwhispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds\\r\\nher nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground. At\\r\\nthe same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we\\r\\nrequire that all things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and\\r\\nsea be infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because\\r\\nunfathomable. We can never have enough of Nature. We must be refreshed\\r\\nby the sight of inexhaustible vigor, vast and Titanic features, the\\r\\nsea-coast with its wrecks, the wilderness with its living and its\\r\\ndecaying trees, the thunder cloud, and the rain which lasts three weeks\\r\\nand produces freshets. We need to witness our own limits transgressed,\\r\\nand some life pasturing freely where we never wander. We are cheered\\r\\nwhen we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and\\r\\ndisheartens us and deriving health and strength from the repast. There\\r\\nwas a dead horse in the hollow by the path to my house, which compelled\\r\\nme sometimes to go out of my way, especially in the night when the air\\r\\nwas heavy, but the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite and\\r\\ninviolable health of Nature was my compensation for this. I love to see\\r\\nthat Nature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be\\r\\nsacrificed and suffered to prey on one another; that tender\\r\\norganizations can be so serenely squashed out of existence like\\r\\npulp,—tadpoles which herons gobble up, and tortoises and toads run over\\r\\nin the road; and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood! With the\\r\\nliability to accident, we must see how little account is to be made of\\r\\nit. The impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence.\\r\\nPoison is not poisonous after all, nor are any wounds fatal. Compassion\\r\\nis a very untenable ground. It must be expeditious. Its pleadings will\\r\\nnot bear to be stereotyped.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly in May, the oaks, hickories, maples, and other trees, just\\r\\nputting out amidst the pine woods around the pond, imparted a\\r\\nbrightness like sunshine to the landscape, especially in cloudy days,\\r\\nas if the sun were breaking through mists and shining faintly on the\\r\\nhill-sides here and there. On the third or fourth of May I saw a loon\\r\\nin the pond, and during the first week of the month I heard the\\r\\nwhippoorwill, the brown-thrasher, the veery, the wood-pewee, the\\r\\nchewink, and other birds. I had heard the wood-thrush long before. The\\r\\nphœbe had already come once more and looked in at my door and window,\\r\\nto see if my house was cavern-like enough for her, sustaining herself\\r\\non humming wings with clinched talons, as if she held by the air, while\\r\\nshe surveyed the premises. The sulphur-like pollen of the pitch-pine\\r\\nsoon covered the pond and the stones and rotten wood along the shore,\\r\\nso that you could have collected a barrel-ful. This is the “sulphur\\r\\nshowers” we hear of. Even in Calidas’ drama of Sacontala, we read of\\r\\n“rills dyed yellow with the golden dust of the lotus.” And so the\\r\\nseasons went rolling on into summer, as one rambles into higher and\\r\\nhigher grass.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus was my first year’s life in the woods completed; and the second\\r\\nyear was similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6th, 1847.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the sick the doctors wisely recommend a change of air and scenery.\\r\\nThank Heaven, here is not all the world. The buck-eye does not grow in\\r\\nNew England, and the mocking-bird is rarely heard here. The wild-goose\\r\\nis more of a cosmopolite than we; he breaks his fast in Canada, takes a\\r\\nluncheon in the Ohio, and plumes himself for the night in a southern\\r\\nbayou. Even the bison, to some extent, keeps pace with the seasons,\\r\\ncropping the pastures of the Colorado only till a greener and sweeter\\r\\ngrass awaits him by the Yellowstone. Yet we think that if rail-fences\\r\\nare pulled down, and stone-walls piled up on our farms, bounds are\\r\\nhenceforth set to our lives and our fates decided. If you are chosen\\r\\ntown-clerk, forsooth, you cannot go to Tierra del Fuego this summer:\\r\\nbut you may go to the land of infernal fire nevertheless. The universe\\r\\nis wider than our views of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet we should oftener look over the tafferel of our craft, like curious\\r\\npassengers, and not make the voyage like stupid sailors picking oakum.\\r\\nThe other side of the globe is but the home of our correspondent. Our\\r\\nvoyaging is only great-circle sailing, and the doctors prescribe for\\r\\ndiseases of the skin merely. One hastens to Southern Africa to chase\\r\\nthe giraffe; but surely that is not the game he would be after. How\\r\\nlong, pray, would a man hunt giraffes if he could? Snipes and woodcocks\\r\\nalso may afford rare sport; but I trust it would be nobler game to\\r\\nshoot one’s self.—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Direct your eye right inward, and you’ll find\\r\\n     A thousand regions in your mind\\r\\n     Yet undiscovered. Travel them, and be\\r\\n     Expert in home-cosmography.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat does Africa,—what does the West stand for? Is not our own interior\\r\\nwhite on the chart? black though it may prove, like the coast, when\\r\\ndiscovered. Is it the source of the Nile, or the Niger, or the\\r\\nMississippi, or a North-West Passage around this continent, that we\\r\\nwould find? Are these the problems which most concern mankind? Is\\r\\nFranklin the only man who is lost, that his wife should be so earnest\\r\\nto find him? Does Mr. Grinnell know where he himself is? Be rather the\\r\\nMungo Park, the Lewis and Clarke and Frobisher, of your own streams and\\r\\noceans; explore your own higher latitudes,—with shiploads of preserved\\r\\nmeats to support you, if they be necessary; and pile the empty cans\\r\\nsky-high for a sign. Were preserved meats invented to preserve meat\\r\\nmerely? Nay, be a Columbus to whole new continents and worlds within\\r\\nyou, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought. Every man is\\r\\nthe lord of a realm beside which the earthly empire of the Czar is but\\r\\na petty state, a hummock left by the ice. Yet some can be patriotic who\\r\\nhave no _self_-respect, and sacrifice the greater to the less. They\\r\\nlove the soil which makes their graves, but have no sympathy with the\\r\\nspirit which may still animate their clay. Patriotism is a maggot in\\r\\ntheir heads. What was the meaning of that South-Sea Exploring\\r\\nExpedition, with all its parade and expense, but an indirect\\r\\nrecognition of the fact, that there are continents and seas in the\\r\\nmoral world to which every man is an isthmus or an inlet, yet\\r\\nunexplored by him, but that it is easier to sail many thousand miles\\r\\nthrough cold and storm and cannibals, in a government ship, with five\\r\\nhundred men and boys to assist one, than it is to explore the private\\r\\nsea, the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean of one’s being alone.—\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Erret, et extremos alter scrutetur Iberos.\\r\\n     Plus habet hic vitæ, plus habet ille viæ.”\\r\\n\\r\\n     Let them wander and scrutinize the outlandish Australians.\\r\\n     I have more of God, they more of the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not worth the while to go round the world to count the cats in\\r\\nZanzibar. Yet do this even till you can do better, and you may perhaps\\r\\nfind some “Symmes’ Hole” by which to get at the inside at last. England\\r\\nand France, Spain and Portugal, Gold Coast and Slave Coast, all front\\r\\non this private sea; but no bark from them has ventured out of sight of\\r\\nland, though it is without doubt the direct way to India. If you would\\r\\nlearn to speak all tongues and conform to the customs of all nations,\\r\\nif you would travel farther than all travellers, be naturalized in all\\r\\nclimes, and cause the Sphinx to dash her head against a stone, even\\r\\nobey the precept of the old philosopher, and Explore thyself. Herein\\r\\nare demanded the eye and the nerve. Only the defeated and deserters go\\r\\nto the wars, cowards that run away and enlist. Start now on that\\r\\nfarthest western way, which does not pause at the Mississippi or the\\r\\nPacific, nor conduct toward a worn-out China or Japan, but leads on\\r\\ndirect a tangent to this sphere, summer and winter, day and night, sun\\r\\ndown, moon down, and at last earth down too.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said that Mirabeau took to highway robbery “to ascertain what\\r\\ndegree of resolution was necessary in order to place one’s self in\\r\\nformal opposition to the most sacred laws of society.” He declared that\\r\\n“a soldier who fights in the ranks does not require half so much\\r\\ncourage as a foot-pad,”—“that honor and religion have never stood in\\r\\nthe way of a well-considered and a firm resolve.” This was manly, as\\r\\nthe world goes; and yet it was idle, if not desperate. A saner man\\r\\nwould have found himself often enough “in formal opposition” to what\\r\\nare deemed “the most sacred laws of society,” through obedience to yet\\r\\nmore sacred laws, and so have tested his resolution without going out\\r\\nof his way. It is not for a man to put himself in such an attitude to\\r\\nsociety, but to maintain himself in whatever attitude he find himself\\r\\nthrough obedience to the laws of his being, which will never be one of\\r\\nopposition to a just government, if he should chance to meet with such.\\r\\n\\r\\nI left the woods for as good a reason as I went there. Perhaps it\\r\\nseemed to me that I had several more lives to live, and could not spare\\r\\nany more time for that one. It is remarkable how easily and insensibly\\r\\nwe fall into a particular route, and make a beaten track for ourselves.\\r\\nI had not lived there a week before my feet wore a path from my door to\\r\\nthe pond-side; and though it is five or six years since I trod it, it\\r\\nis still quite distinct. It is true, I fear that others may have fallen\\r\\ninto it, and so helped to keep it open. The surface of the earth is\\r\\nsoft and impressible by the feet of men; and so with the paths which\\r\\nthe mind travels. How worn and dusty, then, must be the highways of the\\r\\nworld, how deep the ruts of tradition and conformity! I did not wish to\\r\\ntake a cabin passage, but rather to go before the mast and on the deck\\r\\nof the world, for there I could best see the moonlight amid the\\r\\nmountains. I do not wish to go below now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances\\r\\nconfidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the\\r\\nlife which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in\\r\\ncommon hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible\\r\\nboundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish\\r\\nthemselves around and within him; or the old laws be expanded, and\\r\\ninterpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with\\r\\nthe license of a higher order of beings. In proportion as he simplifies\\r\\nhis life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex, and\\r\\nsolitude will not be solitude, nor poverty poverty, nor weakness\\r\\nweakness. If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be\\r\\nlost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a ridiculous demand which England and America make, that you\\r\\nshall speak so that they can understand you. Neither men nor\\r\\ntoad-stools grow so. As if that were important, and there were not\\r\\nenough to understand you without them. As if Nature could support but\\r\\none order of understandings, could not sustain birds as well as\\r\\nquadrupeds, flying as well as creeping things, and _hush_ and _who_,\\r\\nwhich Bright can understand, were the best English. As if there were\\r\\nsafety in stupidity alone. I fear chiefly lest my expression may not be\\r\\n_extra-vagant_ enough, may not wander far enough beyond the narrow\\r\\nlimits of my daily experience, so as to be adequate to the truth of\\r\\nwhich I have been convinced. _Extra vagance!_ it depends on how you are\\r\\nyarded. The migrating buffalo, which seeks new pastures in another\\r\\nlatitude, is not extravagant like the cow which kicks over the pail,\\r\\nleaps the cow-yard fence, and runs after her calf, in milking time. I\\r\\ndesire to speak somewhere _without_ bounds; like a man in a waking\\r\\nmoment, to men in their waking moments; for I am convinced that I\\r\\ncannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true\\r\\nexpression. Who that has heard a strain of music feared then lest he\\r\\nshould speak extravagantly any more forever? In view of the future or\\r\\npossible, we should live quite laxly and undefined in front, our\\r\\noutlines dim and misty on that side; as our shadows reveal an\\r\\ninsensible perspiration toward the sun. The volatile truth of our words\\r\\nshould continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement.\\r\\nTheir truth is instantly _translated_; its literal monument alone\\r\\nremains. The words which express our faith and piety are not definite;\\r\\nyet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior\\r\\nnatures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy level downward to our dullest perception always, and praise that as\\r\\ncommon sense? The commonest sense is the sense of men asleep, which\\r\\nthey express by snoring. Sometimes we are inclined to class those who\\r\\nare once-and-a-half-witted with the half-witted, because we appreciate\\r\\nonly a third part of their wit. Some would find fault with the\\r\\nmorning-red, if they ever got up early enough. “They pretend,” as I\\r\\nhear, “that the verses of Kabir have four different senses; illusion,\\r\\nspirit, intellect, and the exoteric doctrine of the Vedas;” but in this\\r\\npart of the world it is considered a ground for complaint if a man’s\\r\\nwritings admit of more than one interpretation. While England endeavors\\r\\nto cure the potato-rot, will not any endeavor to cure the brain-rot,\\r\\nwhich prevails so much more widely and fatally?\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not suppose that I have attained to obscurity, but I should be\\r\\nproud if no more fatal fault were found with my pages on this score\\r\\nthan was found with the Walden ice. Southern customers objected to its\\r\\nblue color, which is the evidence of its purity, as if it were muddy,\\r\\nand preferred the Cambridge ice, which is white, but tastes of weeds.\\r\\nThe purity men love is like the mists which envelop the earth, and not\\r\\nlike the azure ether beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome are dinning in our ears that we Americans, and moderns generally,\\r\\nare intellectual dwarfs compared with the ancients, or even the\\r\\nElizabethan men. But what is that to the purpose? A living dog is\\r\\nbetter than a dead lion. Shall a man go and hang himself because he\\r\\nbelongs to the race of pygmies, and not be the biggest pygmy that he\\r\\ncan? Let every one mind his own business, and endeavor to be what he\\r\\nwas made.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy should we be in such desperate haste to succeed, and in such\\r\\ndesperate enterprises? If a man does not keep pace with his companions,\\r\\nperhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the\\r\\nmusic which he hears, however measured or far away. It is not important\\r\\nthat he should mature as soon as an apple-tree or an oak. Shall he turn\\r\\nhis spring into summer? If the condition of things which we were made\\r\\nfor is not yet, what were any reality which we can substitute? We will\\r\\nnot be shipwrecked on a vain reality. Shall we with pains erect a\\r\\nheaven of blue glass over ourselves, though when it is done we shall be\\r\\nsure to gaze still at the true ethereal heaven far above, as if the\\r\\nformer were not?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive\\r\\nafter perfection. One day it came into his mind to make a staff. Having\\r\\nconsidered that in an imperfect work time is an ingredient, but into a\\r\\nperfect work time does not enter, he said to himself, It shall be\\r\\nperfect in all respects, though I should do nothing else in my life. He\\r\\nproceeded instantly to the forest for wood, being resolved that it\\r\\nshould not be made of unsuitable material; and as he searched for and\\r\\nrejected stick after stick, his friends gradually deserted him, for\\r\\nthey grew old in their works and died, but he grew not older by a\\r\\nmoment. His singleness of purpose and resolution, and his elevated\\r\\npiety, endowed him, without his knowledge, with perennial youth. As he\\r\\nmade no compromise with Time, Time kept out of his way, and only sighed\\r\\nat a distance because he could not overcome him. Before he had found a\\r\\nstock in all respects suitable the city of Kouroo was a hoary ruin, and\\r\\nhe sat on one of its mounds to peel the stick. Before he had given it\\r\\nthe proper shape the dynasty of the Candahars was at an end, and with\\r\\nthe point of the stick he wrote the name of the last of that race in\\r\\nthe sand, and then resumed his work. By the time he had smoothed and\\r\\npolished the staff Kalpa was no longer the pole-star; and ere he had\\r\\nput on the ferrule and the head adorned with precious stones, Brahma\\r\\nhad awoke and slumbered many times. But why do I stay to mention these\\r\\nthings? When the finishing stroke was put to his work, it suddenly\\r\\nexpanded before the eyes of the astonished artist into the fairest of\\r\\nall the creations of Brahma. He had made a new system in making a\\r\\nstaff, a world with full and fair proportions; in which, though the old\\r\\ncities and dynasties had passed away, fairer and more glorious ones had\\r\\ntaken their places. And now he saw by the heap of shavings still fresh\\r\\nat his feet, that, for him and his work, the former lapse of time had\\r\\nbeen an illusion, and that no more time had elapsed than is required\\r\\nfor a single scintillation from the brain of Brahma to fall on and\\r\\ninflame the tinder of a mortal brain. The material was pure, and his\\r\\nart was pure; how could the result be other than wonderful?\\r\\n\\r\\nNo face which we can give to a matter will stead us so well at last as\\r\\nthe truth. This alone wears well. For the most part, we are not where\\r\\nwe are, but in a false position. Through an infinity of our natures, we\\r\\nsuppose a case, and put ourselves into it, and hence are in two cases\\r\\nat the same time, and it is doubly difficult to get out. In sane\\r\\nmoments we regard only the facts, the case that is. Say what you have\\r\\nto say, not what you ought. Any truth is better than make-believe. Tom\\r\\nHyde, the tinker, standing on the gallows, was asked if he had anything\\r\\nto say. “Tell the tailors,” said he, “to remember to make a knot in\\r\\ntheir thread before they take the first stitch.” His companion’s prayer\\r\\nis forgotten.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call\\r\\nit hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you\\r\\nare richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love\\r\\nyour life, poor as it is. You may perhaps have some pleasant,\\r\\nthrilling, glorious hours, even in a poor-house. The setting sun is\\r\\nreflected from the windows of the alms-house as brightly as from the\\r\\nrich man’s abode; the snow melts before its door as early in the\\r\\nspring. I do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there,\\r\\nand have as cheering thoughts, as in a palace. The town’s poor seem to\\r\\nme often to live the most independent lives of any. May be they are\\r\\nsimply great enough to receive without misgiving. Most think that they\\r\\nare above being supported by the town; but it oftener happens that they\\r\\nare not above supporting themselves by dishonest means, which should be\\r\\nmore disreputable. Cultivate poverty like a garden herb, like sage. Do\\r\\nnot trouble yourself much to get new things, whether clothes or\\r\\nfriends. Turn the old; return to them. Things do not change; we change.\\r\\nSell your clothes and keep your thoughts. God will see that you do not\\r\\nwant society. If I were confined to a corner of a garret all my days,\\r\\nlike a spider, the world would be just as large to me while I had my\\r\\nthoughts about me. The philosopher said: “From an army of three\\r\\ndivisions one can take away its general, and put it in disorder; from\\r\\nthe man the most abject and vulgar one cannot take away his thought.”\\r\\nDo not seek so anxiously to be developed, to subject yourself to many\\r\\ninfluences to be played on; it is all dissipation. Humility like\\r\\ndarkness reveals the heavenly lights. The shadows of poverty and\\r\\nmeanness gather around us, “and lo! creation widens to our view.” We\\r\\nare often reminded that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of\\r\\nCrœsus, our aims must still be the same, and our means essentially the\\r\\nsame. Moreover, if you are restricted in your range by poverty, if you\\r\\ncannot buy books and newspapers, for instance, you are but confined to\\r\\nthe most significant and vital experiences; you are compelled to deal\\r\\nwith the material which yields the most sugar and the most starch. It\\r\\nis life near the bone where it is sweetest. You are defended from being\\r\\na trifler. No man loses ever on a lower level by magnanimity on a\\r\\nhigher. Superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only. Money is not\\r\\nrequired to buy one necessary of the soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nI live in the angle of a leaden wall, into whose composition was poured\\r\\na little alloy of bell metal. Often, in the repose of my mid-day, there\\r\\nreaches my ears a confused _tintinnabulum_ from without. It is the\\r\\nnoise of my contemporaries. My neighbors tell me of their adventures\\r\\nwith famous gentlemen and ladies, what notabilities they met at the\\r\\ndinner-table; but I am no more interested in such things than in the\\r\\ncontents of the Daily Times. The interest and the conversation are\\r\\nabout costume and manners chiefly; but a goose is a goose still, dress\\r\\nit as you will. They tell me of California and Texas, of England and\\r\\nthe Indies, of the Hon. Mr. —— of Georgia or of Massachusetts, all\\r\\ntransient and fleeting phenomena, till I am ready to leap from their\\r\\ncourt-yard like the Mameluke bey. I delight to come to my bearings,—not\\r\\nwalk in procession with pomp and parade, in a conspicuous place, but to\\r\\nwalk even with the Builder of the universe, if I may,—not to live in\\r\\nthis restless, nervous, bustling, trivial Nineteenth Century, but stand\\r\\nor sit thoughtfully while it goes by. What are men celebrating? They\\r\\nare all on a committee of arrangements, and hourly expect a speech from\\r\\nsomebody. God is only the president of the day, and Webster is his\\r\\norator. I love to weigh, to settle, to gravitate toward that which most\\r\\nstrongly and rightfully attracts me;—not hang by the beam of the scale\\r\\nand try to weigh less,—not suppose a case, but take the case that is;\\r\\nto travel the only path I can, and that on which no power can resist\\r\\nme. It affords me no satisfaction to commence to spring an arch before\\r\\nI have got a solid foundation. Let us not play at kittly-benders. There\\r\\nis a solid bottom every where. We read that the traveller asked the boy\\r\\nif the swamp before him had a hard bottom. The boy replied that it had.\\r\\nBut presently the traveller’s horse sank in up to the girths, and he\\r\\nobserved to the boy, “I thought you said that this bog had a hard\\r\\nbottom.” “So it has,” answered the latter, “but you have not got half\\r\\nway to it yet.” So it is with the bogs and quicksands of society; but\\r\\nhe is an old boy that knows it. Only what is thought, said, or done at a\\r\\ncertain rare coincidence is good. I would not be one of those who will\\r\\nfoolishly drive a nail into mere lath and plastering; such a deed would\\r\\nkeep me awake nights. Give me a hammer, and let me feel for the\\r\\nfurring. Do not depend on the putty. Drive a nail home and clinch it so\\r\\nfaithfully that you can wake up in the night and think of your work\\r\\nwith satisfaction,—a work at which you would not be ashamed to invoke\\r\\nthe Muse. So will help you God, and so only. Every nail driven should\\r\\nbe as another rivet in the machine of the universe, you carrying on the\\r\\nwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nRather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth. I sat at a\\r\\ntable where were rich food and wine in abundance, and obsequious\\r\\nattendance, but sincerity and truth were not; and I went away hungry\\r\\nfrom the inhospitable board. The hospitality was as cold as the ices. I\\r\\nthought that there was no need of ice to freeze them. They talked to me\\r\\nof the age of the wine and the fame of the vintage; but I thought of an\\r\\nolder, a newer, and purer wine, of a more glorious vintage, which they\\r\\nhad not got, and could not buy. The style, the house and grounds and\\r\\n“entertainment” pass for nothing with me. I called on the king, but he\\r\\nmade me wait in his hall, and conducted like a man incapacitated for\\r\\nhospitality. There was a man in my neighborhood who lived in a hollow\\r\\ntree. His manners were truly regal. I should have done better had I\\r\\ncalled on him.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow long shall we sit in our porticoes practising idle and musty\\r\\nvirtues, which any work would make impertinent? As if one were to begin\\r\\nthe day with long-suffering, and hire a man to hoe his potatoes; and in\\r\\nthe afternoon go forth to practise Christian meekness and charity with\\r\\ngoodness aforethought! Consider the China pride and stagnant\\r\\nself-complacency of mankind. This generation inclines a little to\\r\\ncongratulate itself on being the last of an illustrious line; and in\\r\\nBoston and London and Paris and Rome, thinking of its long descent, it\\r\\nspeaks of its progress in art and science and literature with\\r\\nsatisfaction. There are the Records of the Philosophical Societies, and\\r\\nthe public Eulogies of _Great Men!_ It is the good Adam contemplating\\r\\nhis own virtue. “Yes, we have done great deeds, and sung divine songs,\\r\\nwhich shall never die,”—that is, as long as _we_ can remember them. The\\r\\nlearned societies and great men of Assyria,—where are they? What\\r\\nyouthful philosophers and experimentalists we are! There is not one of\\r\\nmy readers who has yet lived a whole human life. These may be but the\\r\\nspring months in the life of the race. If we have had the seven-years’\\r\\nitch, we have not seen the seventeen-year locust yet in Concord. We are\\r\\nacquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live. Most\\r\\nhave not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above\\r\\nit. We know not where we are. Beside, we are sound asleep nearly half\\r\\nour time. Yet we esteem ourselves wise, and have an established order\\r\\non the surface. Truly, we are deep thinkers, we are ambitious spirits!\\r\\nAs I stand over the insect crawling amid the pine needles on the forest\\r\\nfloor, and endeavoring to conceal itself from my sight, and ask myself\\r\\nwhy it will cherish those humble thoughts, and hide its head from me\\r\\nwho might, perhaps, be its benefactor, and impart to its race some\\r\\ncheering information, I am reminded of the greater Benefactor and\\r\\nIntelligence that stands over me the human insect.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an incessant influx of novelty into the world, and yet we\\r\\ntolerate incredible dulness. I need only suggest what kind of sermons\\r\\nare still listened to in the most enlightened countries. There are such\\r\\nwords as joy and sorrow, but they are only the burden of a psalm, sung\\r\\nwith a nasal twang, while we believe in the ordinary and mean. We think\\r\\nthat we can change our clothes only. It is said that the British Empire\\r\\nis very large and respectable, and that the United States are a\\r\\nfirst-rate power. We do not believe that a tide rises and falls behind\\r\\nevery man which can float the British Empire like a chip, if he should\\r\\never harbor it in his mind. Who knows what sort of seventeen-year\\r\\nlocust will next come out of the ground? The government of the world I\\r\\nlive in was not framed, like that of Britain, in after-dinner\\r\\nconversations over the wine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe life in us is like the water in the river. It may rise this year\\r\\nhigher than man has ever known it, and flood the parched uplands; even\\r\\nthis may be the eventful year, which will drown out all our muskrats.\\r\\nIt was not always dry land where we dwell. I see far inland the banks\\r\\nwhich the stream anciently washed, before science began to record its\\r\\nfreshets. Every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds of\\r\\nNew England, of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry\\r\\nleaf of an old table of apple-tree wood, which had stood in a farmer’s\\r\\nkitchen for sixty years, first in Connecticut, and afterward in\\r\\nMassachusetts,—from an egg deposited in the living tree many years\\r\\nearlier still, as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it;\\r\\nwhich was heard gnawing out for several weeks, hatched perchance by the\\r\\nheat of an urn. Who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and\\r\\nimmortality strengthened by hearing of this? Who knows what beautiful\\r\\nand winged life, whose egg has been buried for ages under many\\r\\nconcentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society,\\r\\ndeposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree, which\\r\\nhas been gradually converted into the semblance of its well-seasoned\\r\\ntomb,—heard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished\\r\\nfamily of man, as they sat round the festive board,—may unexpectedly\\r\\ncome forth from amidst society’s most trivial and handselled furniture,\\r\\nto enjoy its perfect summer life at last!\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not say that John or Jonathan will realize all this; but such is\\r\\nthe character of that morrow which mere lapse of time can never make to\\r\\ndawn. The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that\\r\\nday dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is\\r\\nbut a morning star.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nON THE DUTY OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE\\r\\n\\r\\nI heartily accept the motto,—“That government is best which governs\\r\\nleast;” and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and\\r\\nsystematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I\\r\\nbelieve—“That government is best which governs not at all;” and when\\r\\nmen are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they\\r\\nwill have. Government is at best but an expedient; but most governments\\r\\nare usually, and all governments are sometimes, inexpedient. The\\r\\nobjections which have been brought against a standing army, and they\\r\\nare many and weighty, and deserve to prevail, may also at last be\\r\\nbrought against a standing government. The standing army is only an arm\\r\\nof the standing government. The government itself, which is only the\\r\\nmode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally\\r\\nliable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it.\\r\\nWitness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few\\r\\nindividuals using the standing government as their tool; for, in the\\r\\noutset, the people would not have consented to this measure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis American government,—what is it but a tradition, though a recent\\r\\none, endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity, but each\\r\\ninstant losing some of its integrity? It has not the vitality and force\\r\\nof a single living man; for a single man can bend it to his will. It is\\r\\na sort of wooden gun to the people themselves; and, if ever they should\\r\\nuse it in earnest as a real one against each other, it will surely\\r\\nsplit. But it is not the less necessary for this; for the people must\\r\\nhave some complicated machinery or other, and hear its din, to satisfy\\r\\nthat idea of government which they have. Governments show thus how\\r\\nsuccessfully men can be imposed on, even impose on themselves, for\\r\\ntheir own advantage. It is excellent, we must all allow; yet this\\r\\ngovernment never of itself furthered any enterprise, but by the\\r\\nalacrity with which it got out of its way. _It_ does not keep the\\r\\ncountry free. _It_ does not settle the West. _It_ does not educate. The\\r\\ncharacter inherent in the American people has done all that has been\\r\\naccomplished; and it would have done somewhat more, if the government\\r\\nhad not sometimes got in its way. For government is an expedient, by\\r\\nwhich men would fain succeed in letting one another alone; and, as has\\r\\nbeen said, when it is most expedient, the governed are most let alone\\r\\nby it. Trade and commerce, if they were not made of India rubber, would\\r\\nnever manage to bounce over obstacles which legislators are continually\\r\\nputting in their way; and, if one were to judge these men wholly by the\\r\\neffects of their actions, and not partly by their intentions, they\\r\\nwould deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons\\r\\nwho put obstructions on the railroads.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, to speak practically and as a citizen, unlike those who call\\r\\nthemselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but\\r\\n_at once_ a better government. Let every man make known what kind of\\r\\ngovernment would command his respect, and that will be one step toward\\r\\nobtaining it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the\\r\\nhands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period\\r\\ncontinue, to rule, is not because they are most likely to be in the\\r\\nright, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they\\r\\nare physically the strongest. But a government in which the majority\\r\\nrule in all cases can not be based on justice, even as far as men\\r\\nunderstand it. Can there not be a government in which the majorities do\\r\\nnot virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience?—in which\\r\\nmajorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency\\r\\nis applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least\\r\\ndegree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a\\r\\nconscience, then? I think that we should be men first, and subjects\\r\\nafterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so\\r\\nmuch as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to\\r\\nassume, is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough\\r\\nsaid that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of\\r\\nconscientious men is a corporation _with_ a conscience. Law never made\\r\\nmen a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the\\r\\nwell-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice. A common and\\r\\nnatural result of an undue respect for the law is, that you may see a\\r\\nfile of soldiers, colonel, captain, corporal, privates, powder-monkeys\\r\\nand all, marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars,\\r\\nagainst their wills, aye, against their common sense and consciences,\\r\\nwhich makes it very steep marching indeed, and produces a palpitation\\r\\nof the heart. They have no doubt that it is a damnable business in\\r\\nwhich they are concerned; they are all peaceably inclined. Now, what\\r\\nare they? Men at all? or small movable forts and magazines, at the\\r\\nservice of some unscrupulous man in power? Visit the Navy Yard, and\\r\\nbehold a marine, such a man as an American government can make, or such\\r\\nas it can make a man with its black arts, a mere shadow and\\r\\nreminiscence of humanity, a man laid out alive and standing, and\\r\\nalready, as one may say, buried under arms with funeral accompaniment,\\r\\nthough it may be\\r\\n\\r\\n     “Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,\\r\\n         As his corpse to the ramparts we hurried;\\r\\n     Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot\\r\\n         O’er the grave where our hero we buried.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mass of men serve the State thus, not as men mainly, but as\\r\\nmachines, with their bodies. They are the standing army, and the\\r\\nmilitia, jailers, constables, _posse comitatus_, &c. In most cases\\r\\nthere is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral\\r\\nsense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and\\r\\nstones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the\\r\\npurpose as well. Such command no more respect than men of straw, or a\\r\\nlump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs.\\r\\nYet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens. Others, as\\r\\nmost legislators, politicians, lawyers, ministers, and office-holders,\\r\\nserve the state chiefly with their heads; and, as they rarely make any\\r\\nmoral distinctions, they are as likely to serve the devil, without\\r\\n_intending_ it, as God. A very few, as heroes, patriots, martyrs,\\r\\nreformers in the great sense, and _men_, serve the State with their\\r\\nconsciences also, and so necessarily resist it for the most part; and\\r\\nthey are commonly treated by it as enemies. A wise man will only be\\r\\nuseful as a man, and will not submit to be “clay,” and “stop a hole to\\r\\nkeep the wind away,” but leave that office to his dust at least:\\r\\n\\r\\n     “I am too high-born to be propertied,\\r\\n     To be a secondary at control,\\r\\n     Or useful serving-man and instrument\\r\\n     To any sovereign state throughout the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe who gives himself entirely to his fellow-men appears to them useless\\r\\nand selfish; but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a\\r\\nbenefactor and philanthropist.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does it become a man to behave toward the American government\\r\\ntoday? I answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it.\\r\\nI cannot for an instant recognize that political organization as _my_\\r\\ngovernment which is the _slave’s_ government also.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse\\r\\nallegiance to and to resist the government, when its tyranny or its\\r\\ninefficiency are great and unendurable. But almost all say that such is\\r\\nnot the case now. But such was the case, they think, in the Revolution\\r\\nof ’75. If one were to tell me that this was a bad government because\\r\\nit taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports, it is most\\r\\nprobable that I should not make an ado about it, for I can do without\\r\\nthem: all machines have their friction; and possibly this does enough\\r\\ngood to counter-balance the evil. At any rate, it is a great evil to\\r\\nmake a stir about it. But when the friction comes to have its machine,\\r\\nand oppression and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a\\r\\nmachine any longer. In other words, when a sixth of the population of a\\r\\nnation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves, and\\r\\na whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army,\\r\\nand subjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon for\\r\\nhonest men to rebel and revolutionize. What makes this duty the more\\r\\nurgent is that fact, that the country so overrun is not our own, but\\r\\nours is the invading army.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaley, a common authority with many on moral questions, in his chapter\\r\\non the “Duty of Submission to Civil Government,” resolves all civil\\r\\nobligation into expediency; and he proceeds to say, “that so long as\\r\\nthe interest of the whole society requires it, that is, so long as the\\r\\nestablished government cannot be resisted or changed without public\\r\\ninconveniency, it is the will of God that the established government be\\r\\nobeyed, and no longer.”—“This principle being admitted, the justice of\\r\\nevery particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the\\r\\nquantity of the danger and grievance on the one side, and of the\\r\\nprobability and expense of redressing it on the other.” Of this, he\\r\\nsays, every man shall judge for himself. But Paley appears never to\\r\\nhave contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does not\\r\\napply, in which a people, as well as an individual, must do justice,\\r\\ncost what it may. If I have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning\\r\\nman, I must restore it to him though I drown myself. This, according to\\r\\nPaley, would be inconvenient. But he that would save his life, in such\\r\\na case, shall lose it. This people must cease to hold slaves, and to\\r\\nmake war on Mexico, though it cost them their existence as a people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their practice, nations agree with Paley; but does anyone think that\\r\\nMassachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis?\\r\\n\\r\\n     “A drab of state, a cloth-o’-silver slut,\\r\\n     To have her train borne up, and her soul trail in the dirt.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPractically speaking, the opponents to a reform in Massachusetts are\\r\\nnot a hundred thousand politicians at the South, but a hundred thousand\\r\\nmerchants and farmers here, who are more interested in commerce and\\r\\nagriculture than they are in humanity, and are not prepared to do\\r\\njustice to the slave and to Mexico, _cost what it may_. I quarrel not\\r\\nwith far-off foes, but with those who, near at home, co-operate with,\\r\\nand do the bidding of those far away, and without whom the latter would\\r\\nbe harmless. We are accustomed to say, that the mass of men are\\r\\nunprepared; but improvement is slow, because the few are not materially\\r\\nwiser or better than the many. It is not so important that many should\\r\\nbe as good as you, as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere;\\r\\nfor that will leaven the whole lump. There are thousands who are _in\\r\\nopinion_ opposed to slavery and to the war, who yet in effect do\\r\\nnothing to put an end to them; who, esteeming themselves children of\\r\\nWashington and Franklin, sit down with their hands in their pockets,\\r\\nand say that they know not what to do, and do nothing; who even\\r\\npostpone the question of freedom to the question of free-trade, and\\r\\nquietly read the prices-current along with the latest advices from\\r\\nMexico, after dinner, and, it may be, fall asleep over them both. What\\r\\nis the price-current of an honest man and patriot today? They hesitate,\\r\\nand they regret, and sometimes they petition; but they do nothing in\\r\\nearnest and with effect. They will wait, well disposed, for others to\\r\\nremedy the evil, that they may no longer have it to regret. At most,\\r\\nthey give only a cheap vote, and a feeble countenance and Godspeed, to\\r\\nthe right, as it goes by them. There are nine hundred and ninety-nine\\r\\npatrons of virtue to one virtuous man; but it is easier to deal with\\r\\nthe real possessor of a thing than with the temporary guardian of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll voting is a sort of gaming, like chequers or backgammon, with a\\r\\nslight moral tinge to it, a playing with right and wrong, with moral\\r\\nquestions; and betting naturally accompanies it. The character of the\\r\\nvoters is not staked. I cast my vote, perchance, as I think right; but\\r\\nI am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail. I am willing\\r\\nto leave it to the majority. Its obligation, therefore, never exceeds\\r\\nthat of expediency. Even voting _for the right_ is _doing_ nothing for\\r\\nit. It is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should\\r\\nprevail. A wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance,\\r\\nnor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority. There is but\\r\\nlittle virtue in the action of masses of men. When the majority shall\\r\\nat length vote for the abolition of slavery, it will be because they\\r\\nare indifferent to slavery, or because there is but little slavery left\\r\\nto be abolished by their vote. _They_ will then be the only slaves.\\r\\nOnly _his_ vote can hasten the abolition of slavery who asserts his own\\r\\nfreedom by his vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hear of a convention to be held at Baltimore, or elsewhere, for the\\r\\nselection of a candidate for the Presidency, made up chiefly of\\r\\neditors, and men who are politicians by profession; but I think, what\\r\\nis it to any independent, intelligent, and respectable man what\\r\\ndecision they may come to, shall we not have the advantage of his\\r\\nwisdom and honesty, nevertheless? Can we not count upon some\\r\\nindependent votes? Are there not many individuals in the country who do\\r\\nnot attend conventions? But no: I find that the respectable man, so\\r\\ncalled, has immediately drifted from his position, and despairs of his\\r\\ncountry, when his country has more reasons to despair of him. He\\r\\nforthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected as the only\\r\\n_available_ one, thus proving that he is himself _available_ for any\\r\\npurposes of the demagogue. His vote is of no more worth than that of\\r\\nany unprincipled foreigner or hireling native, who may have been\\r\\nbought. Oh for a man who is a _man_, and, as my neighbor says, has a\\r\\nbone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through! Our\\r\\nstatistics are at fault: the population has been returned too large.\\r\\nHow many _men_ are there to a square thousand miles in the country?\\r\\nHardly one. Does not America offer any inducement for men to settle\\r\\nhere? The American has dwindled into an Odd Fellow,—one who may be\\r\\nknown by the development of his organ of gregariousness, and a manifest\\r\\nlack of intellect and cheerful self-reliance; whose first and chief\\r\\nconcern, on coming into the world, is to see that the alms-houses are\\r\\nin good repair; and, before yet he has lawfully donned the virile garb,\\r\\nto collect a fund for the support of the widows and orphans that may\\r\\nbe; who, in short, ventures to live only by the aid of the Mutual\\r\\nInsurance company, which has promised to bury him decently.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not a man’s duty, as a matter of course, to devote himself to the\\r\\neradication of any, even the most enormous wrong; he may still properly\\r\\nhave other concerns to engage him; but it is his duty, at least, to\\r\\nwash his hands of it, and, if he gives it no thought longer, not to\\r\\ngive it practically his support. If I devote myself to other pursuits\\r\\nand contemplations, I must first see, at least, that I do not pursue\\r\\nthem sitting upon another man’s shoulders. I must get off him first,\\r\\nthat he may pursue his contemplations too. See what gross inconsistency\\r\\nis tolerated. I have heard some of my townsmen say, “I should like to\\r\\nhave them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves,\\r\\nor to march to Mexico,—see if I would go;” and yet these very men have\\r\\neach, directly by their allegiance, and so indirectly, at least, by\\r\\ntheir money, furnished a substitute. The soldier is applauded who\\r\\nrefuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain\\r\\nthe unjust government which makes the war; is applauded by those whose\\r\\nown act and authority he disregards and sets at naught; as if the State\\r\\nwere penitent to that degree that it hired one to scourge it while it\\r\\nsinned, but not to that degree that it left off sinning for a moment.\\r\\nThus, under the name of Order and Civil Government, we are all made at\\r\\nlast to pay homage to and support our own meanness. After the first\\r\\nblush of sin, comes its indifference; and from immoral it becomes, as\\r\\nit were, _un_moral, and not quite unnecessary to that life which we\\r\\nhave made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterested\\r\\nvirtue to sustain it. The slight reproach to which the virtue of\\r\\npatriotism is commonly liable, the noble are most likely to incur.\\r\\nThose who, while they disapprove of the character and measures of a\\r\\ngovernment, yield to it their allegiance and support, are undoubtedly\\r\\nits most conscientious supporters, and so frequently the most serious\\r\\nobstacles to reform. Some are petitioning the State to dissolve the\\r\\nUnion, to disregard the requisitions of the President. Why do they not\\r\\ndissolve it themselves,—the union between themselves and the State,—and\\r\\nrefuse to pay their quota into its treasury? Do not they stand in same\\r\\nrelation to the State, that the State does to the Union? And have not\\r\\nthe same reasons prevented the State from resisting the Union, which\\r\\nhave prevented them from resisting the State?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely, and enjoy\\r\\n_it?_ Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he is\\r\\naggrieved? If you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbor,\\r\\nyou do not rest satisfied with knowing you are cheated, or with saying\\r\\nthat you are cheated, or even with petitioning him to pay you your due;\\r\\nbut you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount, and see\\r\\nthat you are never cheated again. Action from principle,—the perception\\r\\nand the performance of right,—changes things and relations; it is\\r\\nessentially revolutionary, and does not consist wholly with anything\\r\\nwhich was. It not only divided states and churches, it divides\\r\\nfamilies; aye, it divides the _individual_, separating the diabolical\\r\\nin him from the divine.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnjust laws exist: shall we be content to obey them, or shall we\\r\\nendeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall\\r\\nwe transgress them at once? Men generally, under such a government as\\r\\nthis, think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the\\r\\nmajority to alter them. They think that, if they should resist, the\\r\\nremedy would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the\\r\\ngovernment itself that the remedy _is_ worse than the evil. _It_ makes\\r\\nit worse. Why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform?\\r\\nWhy does it not cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist\\r\\nbefore it is hurt? Why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the\\r\\nalert to point out its faults, and _do_ better than it would have them?\\r\\nWhy does it always crucify Christ, and excommunicate Copernicus and\\r\\nLuther, and pronounce Washington and Franklin rebels?\\r\\n\\r\\nOne would think, that a deliberate and practical denial of its\\r\\nauthority was the only offence never contemplated by government; else,\\r\\nwhy has it not assigned its definite, its suitable and proportionate\\r\\npenalty? If a man who has no property refuses but once to earn nine\\r\\nshillings for the State, he is put in prison for a period unlimited by\\r\\nany law that I know, and determined only by the discretion of those who\\r\\nplaced him there; but if he should steal ninety times nine shillings\\r\\nfrom the State, he is soon permitted to go at large again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of\\r\\ngovernment, let it go, let it go: perchance it will wear\\r\\nsmooth,—certainly the machine will wear out. If the injustice has a\\r\\nspring, or a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,\\r\\nthen perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than\\r\\nthe evil; but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the\\r\\nagent of injustice to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your\\r\\nlife be a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to\\r\\nsee, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I\\r\\ncondemn.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for adopting the ways which the State has provided for remedying the\\r\\nevil, I know not of such ways. They take too much time, and a man’s\\r\\nlife will be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into this\\r\\nworld, not chiefly to make this a good place to live in, but to live in\\r\\nit, be it good or bad. A man has not every thing to do, but something;\\r\\nand because he cannot do _every thing_, it is not necessary that he\\r\\nshould do _something_ wrong. It is not my business to be petitioning\\r\\nthe Governor or the Legislature any more than it is theirs to petition\\r\\nme; and, if they should not hear my petition, what should I do then?\\r\\nBut in this case the State has provided no way: its very Constitution\\r\\nis the evil. This may seem to be harsh and stubborn and\\r\\nunconcilliatory; but it is to treat with the utmost kindness and\\r\\nconsideration the only spirit that can appreciate or deserves it. So is\\r\\nall change for the better, like birth and death which convulse the\\r\\nbody.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not hesitate to say, that those who call themselves abolitionists\\r\\nshould at once effectually withdraw their support, both in person and\\r\\nproperty, from the government of Massachusetts, and not wait till they\\r\\nconstitute a majority of one, before they suffer the right to prevail\\r\\nthrough them. I think that it is enough if they have God on their side,\\r\\nwithout waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more right than\\r\\nhis neighbors constitutes a majority of one already.\\r\\n\\r\\nI meet this American government, or its representative, the State\\r\\ngovernment, directly, and face to face, once a year, no more, in the\\r\\nperson of its tax-gatherer; this is the only mode in which a man\\r\\nsituated as I am necessarily meets it; and it then says distinctly,\\r\\nRecognize me; and the simplest, the most effectual, and, in the present\\r\\nposture of affairs, the indispensablest mode of treating with it on\\r\\nthis head, of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it,\\r\\nis to deny it then. My civil neighbor, the tax-gatherer, is the very\\r\\nman I have to deal with,—for it is, after all, with men and not with\\r\\nparchment that I quarrel,—and he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent\\r\\nof the government. How shall he ever know well what he is and does as\\r\\nan officer of the government, or as a man, until he is obliged to\\r\\nconsider whether he shall treat me, his neighbor, for whom he has\\r\\nrespect, as a neighbor and well-disposed man, or as a maniac and\\r\\ndisturber of the peace, and see if he can get over this obstruction to\\r\\nhis neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech\\r\\ncorresponding with his action? I know this well, that if one thousand,\\r\\nif one hundred, if ten men whom I could name,—if ten _honest_ men\\r\\nonly,—aye, if _one_ HONEST man, in this State of Massachusetts,\\r\\n_ceasing to hold slaves_, were actually to withdraw from this\\r\\ncopartnership, and be locked up in the county jail therefor, it would\\r\\nbe the abolition of slavery in America. For it matters not how small\\r\\nthe beginning may seem to be: what is once well done is done for ever.\\r\\nBut we love better to talk about it: that we say is our mission. Reform\\r\\nkeeps many scores of newspapers in its service, but not one man. If my\\r\\nesteemed neighbor, the State’s ambassador, who will devote his days to\\r\\nthe settlement of the question of human rights in the Council Chamber,\\r\\ninstead of being threatened with the prisons of Carolina, were to sit\\r\\ndown the prisoner of Massachusetts, that State which is so anxious to\\r\\nfoist the sin of slavery upon her sister,—though at present she can\\r\\ndiscover only an act of inhospitality to be the ground of a quarrel\\r\\nwith her,—the Legislature would not wholly waive the subject of the\\r\\nfollowing winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder a government which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a\\r\\njust man is also a prison. The proper place today, the only place which\\r\\nMassachusetts has provided for her freer and less desponding spirits,\\r\\nis in her prisons, to be put out and locked out of the State by her own\\r\\nact, as they have already put themselves out by their principles. It is\\r\\nthere that the fugitive slave, and the Mexican prisoner on parole, and\\r\\nthe Indian come to plead the wrongs of his race, should find them; on\\r\\nthat separate, but more free and honorable ground, where the State\\r\\nplaces those who are not _with_ her but _against_ her,—the only house\\r\\nin a slave-state in which a free man can abide with honor. If any think\\r\\nthat their influence would be lost there, and their voices no longer\\r\\nafflict the ear of the State, that they would not be as an enemy within\\r\\nits walls, they do not know by how much truth is stronger than error,\\r\\nnor how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injustice\\r\\nwho has experienced a little in his own person. Cast your whole vote,\\r\\nnot a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence. A minority is\\r\\npowerless while it conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority\\r\\nthen; but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight. If the\\r\\nalternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and\\r\\nslavery, the State will not hesitate which to choose. If a thousand men\\r\\nwere not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent\\r\\nand bloody measure, as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to\\r\\ncommit violence and shed innocent blood. This is, in fact, the\\r\\ndefinition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. If the\\r\\ntax-gatherer, or any other public officer, asks me, as one has done,\\r\\n“But what shall I do?” my answer is, “If you really wish to do any\\r\\nthing, resign your office.” When the subject has refused allegiance,\\r\\nand the officer has resigned his office, then the revolution is\\r\\naccomplished. But even suppose blood should flow. Is there not a sort\\r\\nof blood shed when the conscience is wounded? Through this wound a\\r\\nman’s real manhood and immortality flow out, and he bleeds to an\\r\\neverlasting death. I see this blood flowing now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender, rather than the\\r\\nseizure of his goods,—though both will serve the same purpose,—because\\r\\nthey who assert the purest right, and consequently are most dangerous\\r\\nto a corrupt State, commonly have not spent much time in accumulating\\r\\nproperty. To such the State renders comparatively small service, and a\\r\\nslight tax is wont to appear exorbitant, particularly if they are\\r\\nobliged to earn it by special labor with their hands. If there were one\\r\\nwho lived wholly without the use of money, the State itself would\\r\\nhesitate to demand it of him. But the rich man—not to make any\\r\\ninvidious comparison—is always sold to the institution which makes him\\r\\nrich. Absolutely speaking, the more money, the less virtue; for money\\r\\ncomes between a man and his objects, and obtains them for him; it was\\r\\ncertainly no great virtue to obtain it. It puts to rest many questions\\r\\nwhich he would otherwise be taxed to answer; while the only new\\r\\nquestion which it puts is the hard but superfluous one, how to spend\\r\\nit. Thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet. The\\r\\nopportunities of living are diminished in proportion as what are called\\r\\nthe “means” are increased. The best thing a man can do for his culture\\r\\nwhen he is rich is to endeavor to carry out those schemes which he\\r\\nentertained when he was poor. Christ answered the Herodians according\\r\\nto their condition. “Show me the tribute-money,” said he;—and one took\\r\\na penny out of his pocket;—if you use money which has the image of\\r\\nCæsar on it, and which he has made current and valuable, that is, _if\\r\\nyou are men of the State_, and gladly enjoy the advantages of Cæsar’s\\r\\ngovernment, then pay him back some of his own when he demands it;\\r\\n“Render therefore to Cæsar that which is Cæsar’s and to God those\\r\\nthings which are God’s,”—leaving them no wiser than before as to which\\r\\nwas which; for they did not wish to know.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I converse with the freest of my neighbors, I perceive that,\\r\\nwhatever they may say about the magnitude and seriousness of the\\r\\nquestion, and their regard for the public tranquillity, the long and\\r\\nthe short of the matter is, that they cannot spare the protection of\\r\\nthe existing government, and they dread the consequences of\\r\\ndisobedience to it to their property and families. For my own part, I\\r\\nshould not like to think that I ever rely on the protection of the\\r\\nState. But, if I deny the authority of the State when it presents its\\r\\ntax-bill, it will soon take and waste all my property, and so harass me\\r\\nand my children without end. This is hard. This makes it impossible for\\r\\na man to live honestly and at the same time comfortably in outward\\r\\nrespects. It will not be worth the while to accumulate property; that\\r\\nwould be sure to go again. You must hire or squat somewhere, and raise\\r\\nbut a small crop, and eat that soon. You must live within yourself, and\\r\\ndepend upon yourself, always tucked up and ready for a start, and not\\r\\nhave many affairs. A man may grow rich in Turkey even, if he will be in\\r\\nall respects a good subject of the Turkish government. Confucius\\r\\nsaid,—“If a State is governed by the principles of reason, poverty and\\r\\nmisery are subjects of shame; if a State is not governed by the\\r\\nprinciples of reason, riches and honors are the subjects of shame.” No:\\r\\nuntil I want the protection of Massachusetts to be extended to me in\\r\\nsome distant southern port, where my liberty is endangered, or until I\\r\\nam bent solely on building up an estate at home by peaceful enterprise,\\r\\nI can afford to refuse allegiance to Massachusetts, and her right to my\\r\\nproperty and life. It costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty\\r\\nof disobedience to the State, than it would to obey. I should feel as\\r\\nif I were worth less in that case.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome years ago, the State met me in behalf of the church, and commanded\\r\\nme to pay a certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whose\\r\\npreaching my father attended, but never I myself. “Pay it,” it said,\\r\\n“or be locked up in the jail.” I declined to pay. But, unfortunately,\\r\\nanother man saw fit to pay it. I did not see why the schoolmaster\\r\\nshould be taxed to support the priest, and not the priest the\\r\\nschoolmaster; for I was not the State’s schoolmaster, but I supported\\r\\nmyself by voluntary subscription. I did not see why the lyceum should\\r\\nnot present its tax-bill, and have the State to back its demand, as\\r\\nwell as the church. However, at the request of the selectmen, I\\r\\ncondescended to make some such statement as this in writing:—“Know all\\r\\nmen by these presents, that I, Henry Thoreau, do not wish to be\\r\\nregarded as a member of any incorporated society which I have not\\r\\njoined.” This I gave to the town-clerk; and he has it. The State,\\r\\nhaving thus learned that I did not wish to be regarded as a member of\\r\\nthat church, has never made a like demand on me since; though it said\\r\\nthat it must adhere to its original presumption that time. If I had\\r\\nknown how to name them, I should then have signed off in detail from\\r\\nall the societies which I never signed on to; but I did not know where\\r\\nto find such a complete list.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have paid no poll-tax for six years. I was put into a jail once on\\r\\nthis account, for one night; and, as I stood considering the walls of\\r\\nsolid stone, two or three feet thick, the door of wood and iron, a foot\\r\\nthick, and the iron grating which strained the light, I could not help\\r\\nbeing struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me\\r\\nas if I were mere flesh and blood and bones, to be locked up. I\\r\\nwondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best\\r\\nuse it could put me to, and had never thought to avail itself of my\\r\\nservices in some way. I saw that, if there was a wall of stone between\\r\\nme and my townsmen, there was a still more difficult one to climb or\\r\\nbreak through, before they could get to be as free as I was. I did nor\\r\\nfor a moment feel confined, and the walls seemed a great waste of stone\\r\\nand mortar. I felt as if I alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax.\\r\\nThey plainly did not know how to treat me, but behaved like persons who\\r\\nare underbred. In every threat and in every compliment there was a\\r\\nblunder; for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other\\r\\nside of that stone wall. I could not but smile to see how industriously\\r\\nthey locked the door on my meditations, which followed them out again\\r\\nwithout let or hindrance, and _they_ were really all that was\\r\\ndangerous. As they could not reach me, they had resolved to punish my\\r\\nbody; just as boys, if they cannot come at some person against whom\\r\\nthey have a spite, will abuse his dog. I saw that the State was\\r\\nhalf-witted, that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons,\\r\\nand that it did not know its friends from its foes, and I lost all my\\r\\nremaining respect for it, and pitied it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the state never intentionally confronts a man’s sense,\\r\\nintellectual or moral, but only his body, his senses. It is not armed\\r\\nwith superior wit or honesty, but with superior physical strength. I\\r\\nwas not born to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us\\r\\nsee who is the strongest. What force has a multitude? They only can\\r\\nforce me who obey a higher law than I. They force me to become like\\r\\nthemselves. I do not hear of _men_ being _forced_ to live this way or\\r\\nthat by masses of men. What sort of life were that to live? When I meet\\r\\na government which says to me, “Your money or your life,” why should I\\r\\nbe in haste to give it my money? It may be in a great strait, and not\\r\\nknow what to do: I cannot help that. It must help itself; do as I do.\\r\\nIt is not worth the while to snivel about it. I am not responsible for\\r\\nthe successful working of the machinery of society. I am not the son of\\r\\nthe engineer. I perceive that, when an acorn and a chestnut fall side\\r\\nby side, the one does not remain inert to make way for the other, but\\r\\nboth obey their own laws, and spring and grow and flourish as best they\\r\\ncan, till one, perchance, overshadows and destroys the other. If a\\r\\nplant cannot live according to its nature, it dies; and so a man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe night in prison was novel and interesting enough. The prisoners in\\r\\ntheir shirt-sleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the\\r\\ndoor-way, when I entered. But the jailer said, “Come, boys, it is time\\r\\nto lock up;” and so they dispersed, and I heard the sound of their\\r\\nsteps returning into the hollow apartments. My room-mate was introduced\\r\\nto me by the jailer as “a first-rate fellow and a clever man.” When the\\r\\ndoor was locked, he showed me where to hang my hat, and how he managed\\r\\nmatters there. The rooms were whitewashed once a month; and this one,\\r\\nat least, was the whitest, most simply furnished, and probably the\\r\\nneatest apartment in town. He naturally wanted to know where I came\\r\\nfrom, and what brought me there; and, when I had told him, I asked him\\r\\nin my turn how he came there, presuming him to be an honest man, of\\r\\ncourse; and, as the world goes, I believe he was. “Why,” said he, “they\\r\\naccuse me of burning a barn; but I never did it.” As near as I could\\r\\ndiscover, he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk, and smoked\\r\\nhis pipe there; and so a barn was burnt. He had the reputation of being\\r\\na clever man, had been there some three months waiting for his trial to\\r\\ncome on, and would have to wait as much longer; but he was quite\\r\\ndomesticated and contented, since he got his board for nothing, and\\r\\nthought that he was well treated.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe occupied one window, and I the other; and I saw, that, if one stayed\\r\\nthere long, his principal business would be to look out the window. I\\r\\nhad soon read all the tracts that were left there, and examined where\\r\\nformer prisoners had broken out, and where a grate had been sawed off,\\r\\nand heard the history of the various occupants of that room; for I\\r\\nfound that even here there was a history and a gossip which never\\r\\ncirculated beyond the walls of the jail. Probably this is the only\\r\\nhouse in the town where verses are composed, which are afterward\\r\\nprinted in a circular form, but not published. I was shown quite a long\\r\\nlist of verses which were composed by some young men who had been\\r\\ndetected in an attempt to escape, who avenged themselves by singing\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pumped my fellow-prisoner as dry as I could, for fear I should never\\r\\nsee him again; but at length he showed me which was my bed, and left me\\r\\nto blow out the lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was like travelling into a far country, such as I had never expected\\r\\nto behold, to lie there for one night. It seemed to me that I never had\\r\\nheard the town-clock strike before, nor the evening sounds of the\\r\\nvillage; for we slept with the windows open, which were inside the\\r\\ngrating. It was to see my native village in the light of the Middle\\r\\nAges, and our Concord was turned into a Rhine stream, and visions of\\r\\nknights and castles passed before me. They were the voices of old\\r\\nburghers that I heard in the streets. I was an involuntary spectator\\r\\nand auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of the\\r\\nadjacent village-inn—a wholly new and rare experience to me. It was a\\r\\ncloser view of my native town. I was fairly inside of it. I never had\\r\\nseen its institutions before. This is one of its peculiar institutions;\\r\\nfor it is a shire town. I began to comprehend what its inhabitants were\\r\\nabout.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the morning, our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door,\\r\\nin small oblong-square tin pans, made to fit, and holding a pint of\\r\\nchocolate, with brown bread, and an iron spoon. When they called for\\r\\nthe vessels again, I was green enough to return what bread I had left;\\r\\nbut my comrade seized it, and said that I should lay that up for lunch\\r\\nor dinner. Soon after, he was let out to work at haying in a\\r\\nneighboring field, whither he went every day, and would not be back\\r\\ntill noon; so he bade me good-day, saying that he doubted if he should\\r\\nsee me again.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I came out of prison,—for some one interfered, and paid the tax,—I\\r\\ndid not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common, such\\r\\nas he observed who went in a youth, and emerged a gray-headed man; and\\r\\nyet a change had to my eyes come over the scene,—the town, and State,\\r\\nand country,—greater than any that mere time could effect. I saw yet\\r\\nmore distinctly the State in which I lived. I saw to what extent the\\r\\npeople among whom I lived could be trusted as good neighbors and\\r\\nfriends; that their friendship was for summer weather only; that they\\r\\ndid not greatly purpose to do right; that they were a distinct race\\r\\nfrom me by their prejudices and superstitions, as the Chinamen and\\r\\nMalays are; that, in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks,\\r\\nnot even to their property; that, after all, they were not so noble but\\r\\nthey treated the thief as he had treated them, and hoped, by a certain\\r\\noutward observance and a few prayers, and by walking in a particular\\r\\nstraight though useless path from time to time, to save their souls.\\r\\nThis may be to judge my neighbors harshly; for I believe that most of\\r\\nthem are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail in\\r\\ntheir village.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was formerly the custom in our village, when a poor debtor came out\\r\\nof jail, for his acquaintances to salute him, looking through their\\r\\nfingers, which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window,\\r\\n“How do ye do?” My neighbors did not thus salute me, but first looked\\r\\nat me, and then at one another, as if I had returned from a long\\r\\njourney. I was put into jail as I was going to the shoemaker’s to get a\\r\\nshoe which was mended. When I was let out the next morning, I proceeded\\r\\nto finish my errand, and, having put on my mended shoe, joined a\\r\\nhuckleberry party, who were impatient to put themselves under my\\r\\nconduct; and in half an hour,—for the horse was soon tackled,—was in\\r\\nthe midst of a huckleberry field, on one of our highest hills, two\\r\\nmiles off; and then the State was nowhere to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the whole history of “My Prisons.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never declined paying the highway tax, because I am as desirous\\r\\nof being a good neighbor as I am of being a bad subject; and, as for\\r\\nsupporting schools, I am doing my part to educate my fellow-countrymen\\r\\nnow. It is for no particular item in the tax-bill that I refuse to pay\\r\\nit. I simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to withdraw and\\r\\nstand aloof from it effectually. I do not care to trace the course of\\r\\nmy dollar, if I could, till it buys a man, or a musket to shoot one\\r\\nwith,—the dollar is innocent,—but I am concerned to trace the effects\\r\\nof my allegiance. In fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after\\r\\nmy fashion, though I will still make use and get what advantages of her\\r\\nI can, as is usual in such cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf others pay the tax which is demanded of me, from a sympathy with the\\r\\nState, they do but what they have already done in their own case, or\\r\\nrather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the State requires.\\r\\nIf they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed,\\r\\nto save his property or prevent his going to jail, it is because they\\r\\nhave not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings\\r\\ninterfere with the public good.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis, then, is my position at present. But one cannot be too much on\\r\\nhis guard in such a case, lest his actions be biassed by obstinacy, or\\r\\nan undue regard for the opinions of men. Let him see that he does only\\r\\nwhat belongs to himself and to the hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think sometimes, Why, this people mean well; they are only ignorant;\\r\\nthey would do better if they knew how: why give your neighbors this\\r\\npain to treat you as they are not inclined to? But I think, again, this\\r\\nis no reason why I should do as they do, or permit others to suffer\\r\\nmuch greater pain of a different kind. Again, I sometimes say to\\r\\nmyself, When many millions of men, without heat, without ill-will,\\r\\nwithout personal feeling of any kind, demand of you a few shillings\\r\\nonly, without the possibility, such is their constitution, of\\r\\nretracting or altering their present demand, and without the\\r\\npossibility, on your side, of appeal to any other millions, why expose\\r\\nyourself to this overwhelming brute force? You do not resist cold and\\r\\nhunger, the winds and the waves, thus obstinately; you quietly submit\\r\\nto a thousand similar necessities. You do not put your head into the\\r\\nfire. But just in proportion as I regard this as not wholly a brute\\r\\nforce, but partly a human force, and consider that I have relations to\\r\\nthose millions as to so many millions of men, and not of mere brute or\\r\\ninanimate things, I see that appeal is possible, first and\\r\\ninstantaneously, from them to the Maker of them, and, secondly, from\\r\\nthem to themselves. But, if I put my head deliberately into the fire,\\r\\nthere is no appeal to fire or to the Maker of fire, and I have only\\r\\nmyself to blame. If I could convince myself that I have any right to be\\r\\nsatisfied with men as they are, and to treat them accordingly, and not\\r\\naccording, in some respects, to my requisitions and expectations of\\r\\nwhat they and I ought to be, then, like a good Mussulman and fatalist,\\r\\nI should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are, and say it\\r\\nis the will of God. And, above all, there is this difference between\\r\\nresisting this and a purely brute or natural force, that I can resist\\r\\nthis with some effect; but I cannot expect, like Orpheus, to change the\\r\\nnature of the rocks and trees and beasts.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation. I do not wish to split\\r\\nhairs, to make fine distinctions, or set myself up as better than my\\r\\nneighbors. I seek rather, I may say, even an excuse for conforming to\\r\\nthe laws of the land. I am but too ready to conform to them. Indeed I\\r\\nhave reason to suspect myself on this head; and each year, as the\\r\\ntax-gatherer comes round, I find myself disposed to review the acts and\\r\\nposition of the general and state governments, and the spirit of the\\r\\npeople to discover a pretext for conformity.\\r\\n\\r\\n     “We must affect our country as our parents,\\r\\n     And if at any time we alienate\\r\\n     Out love of industry from doing it honor,\\r\\n     We must respect effects and teach the soul\\r\\n     Matter of conscience and religion,\\r\\n     And not desire of rule or benefit.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe that the State will soon be able to take all my work of this\\r\\nsort out of my hands, and then I shall be no better patriot than my\\r\\nfellow-countrymen. Seen from a lower point of view, the Constitution,\\r\\nwith all its faults, is very good; the law and the courts are very\\r\\nrespectable; even this State and this American government are, in many\\r\\nrespects, very admirable, and rare things, to be thankful for, such as\\r\\na great many have described them; seen from a higher still, and the\\r\\nhighest, who shall say what they are, or that they are worth looking at\\r\\nor thinking of at all?\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the government does not concern me much, and I shall bestow\\r\\nthe fewest possible thoughts on it. It is not many moments that I live\\r\\nunder a government, even in this world. If a man is thought-free,\\r\\nfancy-free, imagination-free, that which _is not_ never for a long time\\r\\nappearing _to be_ to him, unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally\\r\\ninterrupt him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that most men think differently from myself; but those whose\\r\\nlives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindred\\r\\nsubjects content me as little as any. Statesmen and legislators,\\r\\nstanding so completely within the institution, never distinctly and\\r\\nnakedly behold it. They speak of moving society, but have no\\r\\nresting-place without it. They may be men of a certain experience and\\r\\ndiscrimination, and have no doubt invented ingenious and even useful\\r\\nsystems, for which we sincerely thank them; but all their wit and\\r\\nusefulness lie within certain not very wide limits. They are wont to\\r\\nforget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency. Webster\\r\\nnever goes behind government, and so cannot speak with authority about\\r\\nit. His words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no\\r\\nessential reform in the existing government; but for thinkers, and\\r\\nthose who legislate for all time, he never once glances at the subject.\\r\\nI know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this theme would\\r\\nsoon reveal the limits of his mind’s range and hospitality. Yet,\\r\\ncompared with the cheap professions of most reformers, and the still\\r\\ncheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general, his are almost\\r\\nthe only sensible and valuable words, and we thank Heaven for him.\\r\\nComparatively, he is always strong, original, and, above all,\\r\\npractical. Still his quality is not wisdom, but prudence. The lawyer’s\\r\\ntruth is not Truth, but consistency or a consistent expediency. Truth\\r\\nis always in harmony with herself, and is not concerned chiefly to\\r\\nreveal the justice that may consist with wrong-doing. He well deserves\\r\\nto be called, as he has been called, the Defender of the Constitution.\\r\\nThere are really no blows to be given by him but defensive ones. He is\\r\\nnot a leader, but a follower. His leaders are the men of ’87. “I have\\r\\nnever made an effort,” he says, “and never propose to make an effort; I\\r\\nhave never countenanced an effort, and never mean to countenance an\\r\\neffort, to disturb the arrangement as originally made, by which the\\r\\nvarious States came into the Union.” Still thinking of the sanction\\r\\nwhich the Constitution gives to slavery, he says, “Because it was part\\r\\nof the original compact,—let it stand.” Notwithstanding his special\\r\\nacuteness and ability, he is unable to take a fact out of its merely\\r\\npolitical relations, and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposed\\r\\nof by the intellect,—what, for instance, it behoves a man to do here in\\r\\nAmerica today with regard to slavery, but ventures, or is driven, to\\r\\nmake some such desperate answer as the following, while professing to\\r\\nspeak absolutely, and as a private man,—from which what new and\\r\\nsingular code of social duties might be inferred?—“The manner,” says\\r\\nhe, “in which the governments of those States where slavery exists are\\r\\nto regulate it, is for their own consideration, under the\\r\\nresponsibility to their constituents, to the general laws of propriety,\\r\\nhumanity, and justice, and to God. Associations formed elsewhere,\\r\\nspringing from a feeling of humanity, or any other cause, have nothing\\r\\nwhatever to do with it. They have never received any encouragement from\\r\\nme and they never will.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey who know of no purer sources of truth, who have traced up its\\r\\nstream no higher, stand, and wisely stand, by the Bible and the\\r\\nConstitution, and drink at it there with reverence and humanity; but\\r\\nthey who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or that pool,\\r\\ngird up their loins once more, and continue their pilgrimage toward its\\r\\nfountain-head.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo man with a genius for legislation has appeared in America. They are\\r\\nrare in the history of the world. There are orators, politicians, and\\r\\neloquent men, by the thousand; but the speaker has not yet opened his\\r\\nmouth to speak who is capable of settling the much-vexed questions of\\r\\nthe day. We love eloquence for its own sake, and not for any truth\\r\\nwhich it may utter, or any heroism it may inspire. Our legislators have\\r\\nnot yet learned the comparative value of free-trade and of freedom, of\\r\\nunion, and of rectitude, to a nation. They have no genius or talent for\\r\\ncomparatively humble questions of taxation and finance, commerce and\\r\\nmanufactures and agriculture. If we were left solely to the wordy wit\\r\\nof legislators in Congress for our guidance, uncorrected by the\\r\\nseasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people,\\r\\nAmerica would not long retain her rank among the nations. For eighteen\\r\\nhundred years, though perchance I have no right to say it, the New\\r\\nTestament has been written; yet where is the legislator who has wisdom\\r\\nand practical talent enough to avail himself of the light which it\\r\\nsheds on the science of legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe authority of government, even such as I am willing to submit\\r\\nto,—for I will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than I,\\r\\nand in many things even those who neither know nor can do so well,—is\\r\\nstill an impure one: to be strictly just, it must have the sanction and\\r\\nconsent of the governed. It can have no pure right over my person and\\r\\nproperty but what I concede to it. The progress from an absolute to a\\r\\nlimited monarchy, from a limited monarchy to a democracy, is a progress\\r\\ntoward a true respect for the individual. Even the Chinese philosopher\\r\\nwas wise enough to regard the individual as the basis of the empire. Is\\r\\na democracy, such as we know it, the last improvement possible in\\r\\ngovernment? Is it not possible to take a step further towards\\r\\nrecognizing and organizing the rights of man? There will never be a\\r\\nreally free and enlightened State, until the State comes to recognize\\r\\nthe individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its\\r\\nown power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly. I\\r\\nplease myself with imagining a State at last which can afford to be\\r\\njust to all men, and to treat the individual with respect as a\\r\\nneighbor; which even would not think it inconsistent with its own\\r\\nrepose, if a few were to live aloof from it, not meddling with it, nor\\r\\nembraced by it, who fulfilled all the duties of neighbors and\\r\\nfellow-men. A State which bore this kind of fruit, and suffered it to\\r\\ndrop off as fast as it ripened, would prepare the way for a still more\\r\\nperfect and glorious State, which also I have imagined, but not yet\\r\\nanywhere seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

The Foundation\\'s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\'s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation\\'s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\\r\\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\\'s website\\r\\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\\r\\nwidespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\\r\\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n']"
